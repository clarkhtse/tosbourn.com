<p>I work for <a href="http://examtime.com">ExamTime</a>, we make studying and preparing for exams easier by giving both students and teachers powerful learning and planning tools.</p>
<p>We are currently on the lookout for more developers to join our ranks to help us play with Ruby (on Rails) and JavaScript (Backbone, Underscore, jQuery) in our Belfast office.</p>
<p>The people that work here are super smart (I have learned an absolute shed-load in my first 6 months here), the problems are interesting, the craic is good, and we are based in the city center.</p>
<p>If you are a Ruby/JS developer and fancy knowing more about the job you should <a href="http://www.examtime.com/join-us/#Q3">find out more</a> or tweet out to @<a href="https://twitter.com/examtime">examtime</a>.</p>

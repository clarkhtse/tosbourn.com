As most of you will know by now I have been taking part in a personal project to
write 365 articles this year.

I have a [larger post introducing the idea](/365-articles-2015/) and tracking
my current progress should you want to get caught up, I also wrote about [my thoughts one month in](/365-blog-post-project-1-month/).

## Some Stats

I have written 62 posts so far, which is leaving me off target by a small amount, I need to write around 8 posts a week to catch up. I am about 16.98% complete. I would have liked to have been closer to 25% at this stage.

Given that all my posts have been at least 300 words I can very conservatively say I have written over 21,000 words so far, which is pretty cool.

I am surprised that traffic hasn’t increased to my blog even though there is a lot more content being linked to and shared. Maybe it is still too early to really notice any difference.

## What went well

Even though I have lagged behind I have stuck at it, there was a point early in the week where I was thinking I could just chuck in the towel and most people wouldn’t care. But I remember I am not doing this for most people, I am doing it for me!

I don’t want to give excuses but in the past couple of months I have had to [look for another job](/innovation-enterprise/)

## What didn’t go well

I haven’t been working as consistently as I would like, I am doing larger sessions of writing when I chose too. I would have like to have systematised this better so I was doing really small amounts of writing or research.

There are also a couple of blog posts that I had thought of right at the start of this project which I haven’t even looked at writing yet. I need to get my finger out with some of them.

## Thoughts?

Hopefully you have got at least some benefit from my increased output – I would love to hear your thoughts or feelings on this project.

My current plan is to write another update article in 3 months time, so I will be 6 months into this project.

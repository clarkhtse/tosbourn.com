<p>Personally speaking I barely have room on my RSS reader for any more web development / design blogs and I am running out of hours in the day to give all of the content I receive a proper read, so why would I dare to think that adding my own little stream of bloggy goodness into the fold is going to do anything other than get ignored after the first 10 minutes of me spamming it on twitter?</p>
<p>Well the short answer is because I can, with the wonders of wordpress and a decent hosting company I had the space made, the domain bought and paid for and the blog installed in literally 30 minutes (and that included checking my emails, other general internetting and changing a record on my eld vinyl player).</p>
<p>The slightly longer answer is that I have wanted to create something like this for a very long time, I love what I do and I have found that I like to write about things I love to do.  The main issue I have is that I love to do a lot of things, which means I love to write about a lot of things, which means I have my fingers in many pies, which means I often waste evenings doing things on no consequence on some of my smaller sites.  This all changed however when somehow I managed to convince the directors in my work that allowing me to write a web development blog would be an excellent objective for the year - which gave me an excellent incentive to actually do it.</p>

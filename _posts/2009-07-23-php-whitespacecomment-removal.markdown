<p>Here is a handy script that <a href="http://www.charles-reace.com/blog/2009/07/22/strip-comments-and-white-space-from-php-file/">removes whitespace and comments</a> from PHP code and it came via the rather excellent technical blog by <a href="http://www.charles-reace.com/">Charles Reace</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst I would argue that whitespace and comments don't account for any real noticeable performance drop I guess it is good practice to perform obfuscation on any code that will be going into production, you do it with your JavaScript and CSS, so why not your PHP?</p>

<p>If you want the frankly sluggish Lotus Notes to perform a bit better on your mac then one thing you could try is adding the following line to your Preferences.</p>
<blockquote><p>UseBasicNotes=1</p></blockquote>
<p>As settings go this is about as self explanatory as they come, this will tell Notes to use a slightly cut down version of itself.Â  There is nothing I personally haven't been able to do since switching this setting on and the program is more responsive and has better loading and closing times as a result.</p>
<p>The preferences file is called <em>Notes Preferences</em> and can be found in <em>/Users/{you}/Library/Preferences/</em></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/geoffhiggins">@geoffhiggins</a> for the tip.</p>

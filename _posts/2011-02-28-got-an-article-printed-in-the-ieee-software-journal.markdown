<p>I was really stoked when <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DSpinellis" target="_blank">Diomidis Spinellis</a> contacted me and asked me to do a piece for the <a href="http://www.computer.org/">IEEE</a> Software Journal and I was even more excited as the drafts and feedback slowly got turned into an article that was going to be printed in a well respected and well read publication.</p>
<p>To be honest I wasn't 100% convinced it would come to fruition, more my own paranoia than anything else but I just couldn't imagine it.  Then a couple of days ago I received my copies of it through the post and low and behold my ugly mug was on the back page!</p>
<p>The article itself was about <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MS.2011.6" target="_blank">getting the most from the web from a developers point of view</a>, best practices for Google, API searching, things like that and it all came about because of some <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tosbourn/status/27470675181" target="_blank">retweeting</a> that went on for my article on <a href="http://www.tosbourn.com/2010/10/web-stuff/getting-the-most-out-of-stackexchange/">Getting the most out of Stack Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>To that end I want to thank the three people who originally retweeted my link which led to me landing such a cool assignment!</p>

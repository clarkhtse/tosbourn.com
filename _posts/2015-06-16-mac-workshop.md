description: Here is a workshop I gave on Mac Productivity tools/tricks
---

Recently I gave a workshop on how I use my Mac, this was aimed at folk who were coming to the Mac for the first time and may not know some of the nice little keyboard/setting tips and tricks.

Below is the video, and I go into detail about some of the topics covered in the talk on these posts;

* [Up the tracking speed of your mouse](http://tosbourn.com/increase-mouse-speed/)
* [Mac shortcuts](http://tosbourn.com/favourite-mac-shortcuts/)
* [Mac Apps I use to stay productive](http://tosbourn.com/productivity-apps/)

<p>This morning I was lucky enough to attend a tea and bacon bap morning put on by <a href="http://thetomorrowlab.com">The Tomorrow Lab</a> with a talk by <a href="http://twitter.com/derekjohnson">Derek Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>Long time readers might remember I <a title="Interview with Derek Johnson" href="http://tosbourn.com/interview-with-derek-johnson/">interviewed Derek</a> a while back. I have been a friend and a fan of Derek's for some time so I was very excited to hear him speak.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-07-08.38.48.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2232" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-07-08.38.48-1024x768.jpg" alt="2014-08-07 08.38.48" width="474" height="355" /></a></p>
<p>Derek's talk was on Modern Web Design, a topic he has a lot of passion for. The talk was a repurposed version of <a href="http://www.thetomorrowlab.com/2014/04/modern-web-design-works/">an article he had written on the same subject</a>, a great article that is worth a read.</p>
<p>One of the early points Derek made was that designing a website based on pictures created in photoshop is a hangover from when print designers became web designers, he then said how web design is more like product design. I couldn't agree more and thought this was very apt given how this talk took place in the Titanic Quarter.</p>
<h2>A Gutsy Talk</h2>
<p>Derek wasn't  just preaching to the converted, the room wasn't filled with web developers and designers who want to embrace this stuff. It was filled with clients, people The Tomorrow Lab work with. People who maybe like seeing PSDs.</p>
<p>This is important because it is easier to stand in front of people who are going to agree with you than it is to stand up in front of people who might have a different view and try and win them around.</p>
<h2>Some Twitter Notes</h2>
<p>Here are some of the notes myself and others took via Twitter during the talk;</p>

<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/current_setup.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1796" alt="current_setup" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/current_setup.jpg" width="1200" height="548" /></a>You can tell I *really* don't want to start doing the washing up when I decide to put together an off the cuff blog post on something completely meaningless! Here is my current working environment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mini christmas tree - because it is christmas.</li>
<li>Printer that I have used like twice.</li>
<li>The Buffer core values, good to look over them as I learn them.</li>
<li>A Zelda mouse mat, I don't even like Zelda.</li>
<li>A flat mac keyboard, going to replace it at some point for a mechanical one.</li>
<li>Deadpool</li>
<li>Domo-Batman</li>
<li>Hand cream, because sometimes my hands get dry</li>
<li>A big desk notebook, very important for writing off the cuff stuff down on</li>
<li>Important paperwork I really should do (instead of this blog post)</li>
<li>Mini christmas lights - see point 1 :-)</li>
<li>A desktop that is messier than it should be.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some pictures of my unboxing of the Firefox OS Developer Preview Phone. I opted for the Peak model.</p>
<p>I had thought about writing up a "first impressions" post, but unfortunately my sim card won't fit into it and I wouldn't feel comfortable reviewing it purely based on its offerings over WiFi.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-14-13.14.09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1517" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-14-13.14.09-577x1024.jpg" alt="2013-05-14 13.14.09" width="577" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>The packaging it came in was very nice, simple but nice. I was kind of reminded of the packaging that the Amazon Kindle came in, that sort of recycled cardboard look.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-14-13.14.50.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1518" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-14-13.14.50-577x1024.jpg" alt="2013-05-14 13.14.50" width="577" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Accessories (not pictured) that came with the phone include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Ear Buds</li>
<li>A USB charger</li>
<li>A USB power block (unfortunately this is 2-prong and is of no use to me)</li>
<li>A FireFox OS Developer Preview Sticker (I am partial to a good sticker now!)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-14-13.17.24.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1519" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-14-13.17.24-577x1024.jpg" alt="2013-05-14 13.17.24" width="577" height="1024" /></a>Here is the phone turned on, and as I say this is pretty much as far as I will take this blog post. I will say that the screen isn't as responsive as I would like, but I am happy with the weight and build of the phone and it picked up WiFi straight away and grabbed the latest update, which is all good.</p>

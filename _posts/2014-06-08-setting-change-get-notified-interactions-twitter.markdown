<p>Twitter recently made a change which essentially means that you may not necessarily get notified on the website when someone interacts with you.</p>
<p>This is maybe a problem for some of you cool kids with hundreds of thousands of followers but for little old me, I need to make every interaction count!</p>
<p>To update your settings to allow you to get notified of every interaction you can go to <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/web_notifications">this settings page</a>, or do go manually you will want to;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Your Settings Page</li>
<li>Click on Web Notifications</li>
</ol>
<p>The page will look something like this;</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2050" align="aligncenter" width="573"]<img class="size-full wp-image-2050" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screenshot-2014-06-08-21.27.57.png" alt="Twitter Settings Page" width="573" height="432" /> Twitter Settings Page[/caption]</p>
<p>I think the default is now "Tailored for you" which I am guessing means Twitter are applying some algorithm to decide if you want to see the notification or not.</p>
<p>By changing this to "By Anyone" Twitter should no longer apply this filter.</p>

<p>I received this email today from Uptime Robot;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is an exciting day for Uptime Robot as the service now has an API.</p>
<p>Developers can now easily integrate Uptime Robot with any app, display the uptime ratios on other websites, create monitors automatically and so much more.</p>
<p>In order to find more about the API, check the blog post at <a href="http://blog.uptimerobot.com/uptime-robot-gets-an-api/">http://blog.uptimerobot.com/uptime-robot-gets-an-api/</a> and the API documentation at <a href="http://www.uptimerobot.com/api.asp">http://www.uptimerobot.com/api.asp</a> .</p>
<p>Cheers From Uptime Robot</p></blockquote>
<p>This is pretty interesting for a couple of reasons;</p>
<ol>
<li>It will hopefully mean soon there will be some awesome apps and toys to play with.</li>
<li>It will give me the chance to maybe build some awesome apps and toys! Off the top of my head it would be really nice to integrate this into cPanel</li>
</ol>
<p>I look forward to playing about with it at some point.</p>

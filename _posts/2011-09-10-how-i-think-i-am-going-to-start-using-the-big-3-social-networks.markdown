<p>This post was prompted by the fact I wanted to leave a status update and couldn't immediately figure out where.</p>
<p>That is mental, I shouldn't have to think about being social online and where I should be doing it, something needs sorted.</p>
<p>I think the reason I have issues with where to put stuff is because up until now I pretty much post to whichever networks I find the most convenient at that time.  Which is messy to say the least and leaves my Facebook friends with a stream of tech articles when (most of them) aren't techie types.</p>
<p>Some people link all three together, so you post to one place and it posts to them all.  I used to do this but have grown to dislike it, a lot of people have profiles on all three places and if you see the exact same thing posted three times at the same time in three different places it starts to look like spam.</p>
<p>So, as from right now this is how I am going to break my usage down.</p>
<p>Twitter is going to be used mainly to find interesting links / snippets from people in my industry and people with similar interests to me and to post (hopefully) interesting links / snippets to my followers.</p>
<p>Google+ is going to be used for personal rants and to keep in touch with most of the people I know online, also for sharing interesting content I find from other people on Google+</p>
<p>Facebook is going to be used to keep in touch with friends who aren't on Google+ and to maintain the Pages I administer on there.  There are also a couple of groups I want to be more active in on there, so I will maybe start doing that.</p>
<p>I think that makes sense.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know you can <a href="http://twitter.com/tosbourn" target="_blank">follow me</a> on Twitter, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108259413842523229630/" target="_blank">add me</a> on Google+ and f<a href="https://www.facebook.com/toby.osbourn" target="_blank">riend me</a> on Facebook? You do now!</p>
<p>Has anyone else put thought into what they post to what social network? Would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p>There has been a bit of a fuss made about this new google search (which you can access <del><a href="http://www2.sandbox.google.com/">here</a></del> (the link appears to be broken)) on various SEO blogs by people who are worried their rankings are going to go out the window and people are going to have to totally rethink everything they ever thought about SEO.</p>
<p>I honestly think people need to get over this one.  Stop worrying about your rankings for one second and play with the sandbox version of this new search - it is bloody awesome.  Google have delivered an almighty blow to the other search engines. What's that live, you are changing your name to bing and making your site look cute? Nice, well we are going to improve on our already superior algorithm to totally blow performance benchmarks out the window.</p>
<p>Now maybe I am looking on the bright side because so far all my sites seem to have more or less stayed put for the searches I care about, but I like to think there is something else in me that means I am more than happy for Google to make these changes, and that is that I am a lover of the internet.  I spend a stupid amount of time surfing these tubes and anything that can be done to improve my experience is a good thing.</p>

<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1936 size-medium" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Raspberry-Pi-Projects-for-your-Kids_Mini_Cover-243x300.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi Projects for your Kids_Mini_Cover" width="243" height="300" />I am not a kid, but I do own a Raspberry Pi and have a childlike curiosity over things so I guess I am as qualified as anyone to review this book!</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi Projects for kids is a short book written by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/authors/profiles/daniel-bates">Daniel Bates</a> and is available on the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/raspberry-pi-projects-for-kids/book">Packt website</a> and on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00J9B1IPW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00J9B1IPW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=tosbourn-21">Amazon</a>. I am sure you can guess the content of the book!</p>
<p>Without going into extraneous detail Daniel has managed to pack a fair amount in, covering the basics like setting up the Pi and what peripherals you may need to what you can start to do with the Pi.</p>
<p>The first project looks at creating an Angry Birds clone using the kid friendly IDE <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. I haven't used Scratch before but I have heard plenty about it and was able to understand everything that was mentioned. Daniel has done a good job with explaining concepts that might not be obvious to non-programmers.</p>
<p>The second project gets physical! Daniel guides us through making a physical reaction game including an entry level introduction to the GPIO pins and some Python goodness to make it all work.</p>
<p>With the third and final project we stay in Python land to create an interactive map using a GUI library called <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter">Tkinter</a>. As the target audience is for kids and parents I am not going to be too harsh on the code quality, needless to say they haven't bothered with a comprehensive test suite! I will say that I am not sure how fun a younger person might find this task compared to the two before it.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed is it doesn't really target a particular age range for the child, I guess different children develop at different ages but I wonder if that might put people off.</p>
<p>It was an enjoyable read, not too many actionable takeaways personally but I think for the right audience it would be great and I will be recommending it to any parents I know.</p>

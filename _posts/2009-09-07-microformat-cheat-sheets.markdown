<p>Tonight, dear reader, I offer you links to not one, not two, but THREE Microformat cheat sheets.</p>
<p>Microformats are something I have always thought I should implement but for whatever reason have never actually gotten round to it.Â  Having spent a couple of hours tonight looking into them in more detail I am convinced that including them in your web site is the right thing to do and I will be endeavouring to include them in all future projects and fit them in retroactively when I revisit old code.</p>
<p>Here are the links.</p>
<ul>

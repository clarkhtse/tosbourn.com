<p>Wireframing is something that both designers and developers should really learn how to do well, a good wireframe could potentially save you a lot of time when it comes to immediately chucking out bad ideas and it also helps to bring the client in early on in the process. Knocking up a wireframe (as you are about to see) can be an incredibly quick task and it gives you something you can take to the client for early feedback and opinion.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools out there for wireframing, my personal choice is <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>; whilst it has been dismissed by a lot of designers due to the childish nature of the sketches I love it because as a complete novice at design I can quickly and easily put my thoughts onto paper.</p>
<p>Anyway, watch this video and be impressed at the speed at which Clay Parker Jones has knocked out this design (and enjoy the music too, nothing wrong with a bit of MJ!)</p>

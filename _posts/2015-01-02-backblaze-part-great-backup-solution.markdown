<p>In my opinion there are three types of file on your computer</p>
<ul>
<li>Files you want easy access to and don’t want to lose</li>
<li>Files you don’t want to lose but rarely need</li>
<li>Files you never need but your computer does</li>
</ul>
<p>For files you want easy access to and don’t want to lose I would recommend <a href="https://db.tt/IlOuq8C">Dropbox</a>, I have <a href="http://tosbourn.com/the-obligatory-dropbox-post/">written about Dropbox</a> before and it serves the purpose of having your files locally in an easy to find place and backing them up.</p>
<p>For files you never need but your computer does I would recommend Time Machine (in the case of Macs) this is a full system backup that is controlled by the Mac OS.</p>
<p>But that leaves files that you don’t necessarily want to lose but you don’t really want to have to dig around a full system backup to get back should you lose them.</p>
<h2>Backblaze</h2>
<p>This is where <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01tl1n">Backblaze</a> comes in.</p>
<p>To give you the blurb from their website;</p>
<blockquote><p>Designed to be easy to use, there is no need to pick folders and files. All your data gets backed up securely. Your computer is going to love it.</p></blockquote>
<p>You pay $5 a month and install a small program that you can configure telling it what you don’t want backed up (for example, I didn’t want my Dropbox folder backed up, it seemed excessive) and off it goes.</p>
<p>That is literally it – it chugs away in the background, careful not to use up too much bandwidth and backs up your machine continually. I have a backup running as I write this, likely for some images I downloaded about 20 minutes ago.</p>
<h2>I have had to use it in anger</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I recently had to buy a new Macbook Pro, my last one gave up the ghost just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>At the time I wasn’t concerned with Time Machine backups (I should have been) but I did have both Backblaze and Dropbox so I was easily able to grab the files I needed super quick.</p>
<p>(side note: if it wasn't for <a href="https://twitter.com/takete">Nick</a> recommending Backblaze a few weeks previous I would have been shafted!)</p>
<p>Backblaze even has the option to ship out your data on a hard drive if that is easier for you, I believe this is a paid offering but if you have gigabytes upon gigabytes of data it would make a lot of sense.</p>

Amazing.[/caption]</p>
<h2>To sum up</h2>
<p>I am sure there are other solutions out there and I must confess I haven’t done any rigorous testing between different backup solutions but I don’t feel I need to – I have found Backblaze and it is awesome!</p>
<p>If you don’t back up your computer remotely you really should, it is only a matter of time before something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Disclaimer – I have used my <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01tl1n">affiliate code</a>, but in fairness if you use it you get a free month!</p>

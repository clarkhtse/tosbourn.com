<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2221" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Node.js-Blueprints.png" alt="Node.js Blueprints" width="174" height="213" />Recently I had a chance to read Node.js Blueprints, this was timely because for a long time I have wanted  to get better at Node.js.</p>
<p>I grabbed the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00L2AP6O2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00L2AP6O2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=tosbourn-21">Kindle edition</a>, which is pretty much how I read all my books now.</p>
<h2>Node.js Blueprints - The title and subtitle</h2>
<p>The first thing that struct me was the name, I have no idea what a Blueprint means in this context, perhaps I am missing something!</p>
<p>The subtitle kind of confused me too "Develop stunning web and desktop applications with the definitive Node.js" - I am not quite sure what makes Node.js definitive!</p>
<h2>Node.js Blueprints - Content</h2>
<p>One of the things that drew me to this book was the breadth of information it promises to cover, I won't go over absolutely everything in this review but some of the chapters include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing a basic site with Node.js and Express</li>
<li>Making a Blog with Node.js and AngularJS</li>
<li>Using Node.js as a Command-line Tool</li>
<li>Writing a REST API</li>
<li>Developing Desktop Apps with Node.js</li>
</ul>
<p>All great stuff, and like I say there is plenty more including using Grunt, Backbone, and Ember (not all at the same time!)</p>
<h2>Not for JavaScript beginners</h2>
<p>Node.js Blueprints states up front that this is a book for intermediate developers and assumes some prior knowledge with working with JavaScript</p>
<h2>My thoughts on Node.js Blueprints</h2>
<p>I learned an absolute shedload reading this book, it was incredibly clear and covered all of the angles that I would want from a Node.js book.</p>
<p>As well as a load of Node.js knowledge I also found out about <a href="http://dalekjs.com/">DalekJS</a>, which is automated cross-browser testing with JavaScript and <a href="http://absurdjs.com/">AbsurdJS</a> which is an interesting CSS preprocessor!</p>
<p>My one criticism would be that given how things like Ember, Backbone, Angular et al are in constant active development I think using so many different external frameworks to Node might date this book a lot sooner than it should.</p>

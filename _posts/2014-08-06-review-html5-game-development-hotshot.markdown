<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML5-Game-Development-HOTSHOT-Makzan-ebook/dp/B00LMAH28K/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2225" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/hotshot-239x300.png" alt="hotshot" width="239" height="300" /></a>HTML5 game development isn't something that I have never spent any time doing, but I love the idea of using web technologies to do more than just create webpages so I was keen to get reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML5-Game-Development-HOTSHOT-Makzan-ebook/dp/B00LMAH28K/">HTML5 Game Development Hotshot </a>by Makzan.</p>
<p>The book, rich in code samples is a good read, it follows Packt's normal style of writing hotshot books which is to treat each chapter as a mission in which you have a prep stage, a functional stage and a explanation stage.</p>
<p>You can see all the games that the book describes how to make <a href="http://makzan.net/html5-games-list/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I followed through most of the examples and found them easy to follow and I felt the projects were funÂ enough to keep things interesting and progressed in such a way so as not to be intimidating.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about HTML5 game development I recommend this book.</p>

    track, on time and working alongside a team. Fired numerous times from big agencies.
    First hand experience with that, and not he seems to consistently bullshit his
    way through every employment opportunity he is handed. I would never hire a messy
    (code), bullshitter like Barry.\n\n\nExcuse me for bursting your bubbles. Oh...
    I forgot to mention...Although I am a professional Ruby developer I chose to stay
    away from the Ruby on Rails scene. It's full of pretentious, preaching Rails-evangelist
    fanatics who know everything and we done, The we-know-the-way, TDD (Test Driven
    Development) way... which is so dead in the water I am perplexed it is a requirement
    for job applications. \n\n\nLuckily, I have the opportunity to refuse applicants
    with that attitude. It reeks and does nothing for the benefit of all.\n\n\n- Personal
    experience."

    As someone who has worked in the same companies Barry has worked for, everyone has had nothing but positive things to say about him.


    For someone with no qualms it seems very strange that you would bother to comment on a vagrant talk from last year.

  content: "\"Barry G is a genius, isn't he?\"\n\n\n^ NO! Emphatically... excuse me
    but I highly doubt EVERYONE has a positive thing to say about HIS WORK! ;) big
    difference... maybe just the Rails fanatics. Developers, Software Engineers...
    chose NOT to work with Barry Gordon.\n\n\nWake up. Work with him, make sure it's
    complex, with a team of over 2 people. Then come back and say what you said. I
    checked his Github - pathetic to say the least. Very little to no Ruby code visible,
    to dissect. He hides behind bullshit.\nAnd no I won't share my Github, I write
    software I don't develop Ruby on Rails applications for a living... they help
    to feed my software  and I will never hire people like Barry Gordon.\n\n\nToo
    many bad experiences and he just drops off the face of the earth when it starts
    to get real interesting. Pretty typical of him and leaves the whole team with
    a nightmare. Definitely not a guy to work with.\n\n\nBeing a nice guy means you
    don't have the experience to be a good Software Engineer. Another point is this,
    I am just tired of the \"scene\". It stinks, I am busy, I really couldn't be bothered
    explaining why Barry Gordon is a useless developer. \n\n\nWork with him. Ask those
    who he left behind a mess. Ask those MANY people he bullshitted to."

    I'm happy where I am at. You want to speak with me personally, face to face. I will gladfully give you my personal email, mobile and IM contact details. Hell even my address.


    I am not some "nerd" boy Toby. I am deadly serious about what I say. He puts a bad name to a good industry.


    So do you want to meet up?


    You're call...


    on a side not... my industry is outside Northern Ireland. You are very ignorant Toby. Let's meet... what do you say? A nice coffee and a chat and you can repeat exactly what you just said? How's that sound?

    You live in Belfast, how convenient... I could meet you face to face in, lets say 2 hours? You may as well, save you the bother of typing the typical stereotype bullshit "who hides behind anonymity"


    It's just a meet and greet... a chat. A "hello" no more "anonymity" or would you prefer to be safely hidden behind a keyboard without having an opinion, which goes against the grain with a complete stranger? I am assuming you are a very insecure young man who hasn't the nerve to speak your voice to a man face to face about a topic which in my opinion ruined a lot of peoples working careers.


    You live in Belfast, I happen to be here. I drive. Lets meet.

    Well that's that then... point proven.


    I am angry at the fact YOU bum up a guy who RUINED peoples working careers. Do you not get that? What if it was YOU who's career was ruined by Barry Gordon's bullshit?


    Meet me... why not? Because I am angry? You don't even have the slightest Idea who I am, what I have achieved or what way I would treat you. Do you? I'd say I am a very secure, sociable and, I really find this stupid to say, have more presence and personality than you could dream for!


    Live a little Toby, open your eyes and maybe, just maybe you might be something.


    You're just another "nerd" boy with insecurities. You're comment says it all :)

    care about. I am no troll.\n\nAs I said, I apologised. Please do yourself a favour.
    get a life and get put a bit. See Barry for what he is. Troll? \n\nQuite a funny
    remark, I came upon this site accidentally, I NEVER use the internet to post bullshit,
    I've no time for that but when I read the crap about a man I KNOW then you bet
    I will say something. \n\nCareers Toby, just think about it. Go take a walk. You
    want me to say something that is what the definition of trolling is. You are probably
    around 5'5\" - 5'-8\" weigh maybe 13 - 15 stone (could be heavier) waist size
    of over 36. Play video games at every free moment, went top Uni, graduated, maybe
    even got a 2:1 - but got you where? WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE? Or hey... maybe
    you freelance while getting housing benefit (not that NIHE benefits are wrong).
    The relationship thing, I'm just guessing you're not that lucky if you're making
    comments like this \"He is - he keeps on leaving massive shoes for me to fill!\"
    about a guy you maybe don't know that well not have worked with. \n\n\n\nLet me
    say, ANYONE can sound good and ANYONE can get prepared to stand and bullshit in
    front of people AND LOOK SMART while doing it.\n\n\nNow that's trolling, going
    by the definition of it.\n\n\nOf course I could be completely wrong and you run
    a successful software business, and have no time for blogs, video games and most
    importantly would see right through the Barry Gordon bullshit.\n\n\nHi by the
    way."

    You are making less and less sense with each comment. Stop now.


    Interestingly as well as working for a company I couldn't be happier in, I have managed to fit in running several successful companies on the side in between all those games I apparently play.


    Even more interesting is how you claim anyone can sound good and look smart and yet you are coming off as far from either.


    Finally, you have claimed in several places to have no time, you are spending a fair amount on this site (how did you come across here accidentally I wonder, seems very convenient).

    work for someone else. That's fantastic, I'm sure your boss is loving it! Making
    him rich and all that.... the irony is this, your boss probably knows me, comes

    You're perfectly entitled to an opinion. However, I can't see anyone taking you seriously when you're hiding. I know nothing about you so listing what you have experience in is meaningless (you've said it yourself that listing things is pointless).


    Checking github is a pointless exercise, it's neither a positive or a negative indicator as more quality code than we'll ever know is written without being stamped with an MIT/BSD/GPL license and doesn't see the light of day. I don't see you ragging on John Carmack's lack of a github profile, are you going to call him crap too based on an empty github profile.


    Ragging on someone's github profile is exactly what the pretentious crowd that you **seem** to loathe do.


    Truth is, if someone had done the things you claim, it would be a legal matter or for a tribunal. The fact that it isn't suggests an irrational bitterness, which is why it's coming in the form of a masked insult.


    For the record, I've worked with Barry in multiple companies, for years, and his ability to distill complex projects into actionable chunks and have mature design discussions about code means that team members which he leads are happy.


    I'm sure you wouldn't like someone making unsubstantiated (and no, your anonymous word is not enough) claims about you would piss you off, so it's best to lay off other people. If you don't like working with someone then simply don't.

    What a vile, pathetic, infantile little troll you are.


    I've worked with Barry G and I found him to be a superb developer, orders of magnitude smarter than most (you included), and a top bloke overall.


    I'll gladly meet you face to face so I can call you out on your bullshit in person. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to find my contact details (though I reckon it would be a challenge for you), so email me to arrange that meeting.

    will find you, I know exactly where and what you look like. You look like shit

    of activity, or anything related to competitive sport... no no Barry, not video
    games!?\n\nDon't threaten me with violence. You haven't a clue what I have achieved.
    It will result in 2 things, you having a trip to the hospital and me walking away.\n\nOn
    the record, I have threatened NO ONE with violence. Keep that shit out of this
    stupid debate about a useless guy. \n\nCareers were RUINED BY BARRY GORDON! Do
    you guys not get that? Does that fact just happen to slip your minds or are you
    still going to bum, up a piece of crap like him? Seriously, I'm talking he almost
    brought down a fkn company for Christ sake!\n\nSure he may have \"learned\" from
    that but that was that and that's how I remember Barry Gordon fk up extraordinaire

    I don't want any of you pricks knowing who I am. Toby, no offence, you were cool
    enough to let me rant but violent threats I don't take. \n\n\nBarry Gordon smarter
    than most? Adams, that says a lot... how can a smarter than most fk up entire
    architectures? Explain that, please I would love to understand his smartness?
    Or is that you just can't see that this man put many people out of work, not me
    as I was... well if I told you what I was involved in after his many fk ups you'd
    probably guess I was pretty much beside the man. He is over complicated, he does
    not think outside the box, he does not plan in advance, knows a little Ruby, thinks
    TDD is the be all and end all, instils his deluded ideas onto decision makers
    which are so believable they do what he suggests only to find that he \"wanted
    to try out new techniques\" on CLIENT WORK! This is something you just don't risk
    when time is not on your side nor budget.\n\n\nI'm afraid to say Adams, the Barry
    I knew was nothing like what you all seem to think. There are 3 companies who
    fired this man. Why? Why would you be fired? The new company he works for is receiving
    headed letters from the CEO, CTO fo these companies to let his current employer
    know he LIED to them and it took almost 8-10 months to mop up his mess! Why would
    a man so smart and so concise in his visualisation of an OOP architecture make
    so many wrong choices and his code... oh yes... I have seen it. A fkn mess, unreadable,
    no comments completely useless to another team member. I have no gripe against
    the man as a man, but as a work colleague he is useless. KEEP IT FUCKING SIMPLE
    STUPID! Do not over engineer a simple problem (which you guys seem to think is
    extremely complex). \n\n\nFk me... nerds!\n\n\nThat's the Barry Gordon we all
    think is so great and mighty?\n\n\nIt could ruin me, this has gone too far. You
    threatened me Adams with violence. I am up for a meeting but only \"if you dare\"!
    Do you think I am some internet troll? Do actually really think I am some teenage
    idiot? Barry Gordon ruined careers, that was my beef. You just didn't see it!\n\n\n1.
    Jog\n2. Get prepared in a boxing gym\n3. Question your ability to go more than
    20 seconds with someone who REALLY does know what he's doing\n\n\nThis choice
    is yours, I will without a shadow of doubt certainly meet you face to face, alone
    and make you look stupid or you can simply leave it."

    Point of fact - Pretty sure Barry G hasn't been fired from anywhere recently, it would be amazing if you have got the wrong Barry.

    Also - Good you found Barry A so easily, he must be pretty good at that old SEO.

    Finally - every comment you leave improves this page's rank in the commenting system, which will drive more people to see how great Barry Gordon's talk on Vagrant was! Thanks!! xx

  content: "Toby, as willing as you are to allow this crap to continue, BEFORE I read
    that comment from BARRY ADAMS I did NOT make any violent threats. Now take a look?
    Did I make any type of violent threats, I chose to ask to meet you, for a COFFEE
    in a COFFEE HOUSE and then you would see me and then you would realise who I am
    and why I am so pissed at this column about Barry Gordon.\n\n\nOn a side note
    I don't bench press shit mate. Homophobic? Are you taking the piss? To even think
    that is absurd! You simply have no idea at all do you? Now take a think over that
    last comment.\n\n\nI really do not care much if people laugh, they can. I know
    your faces. 12 or 14 years old? haha.. ahhhh... fkn nerds are the laughable guys
    I MAKE MONEY FROM! \n\n\nBarry Adams openly said \"if you dare\", anyone in their
    right mind would consider that a threat. A threat of violence. He's just a chubby
    chap. Wouldn't last a round. So I've no idea why he challenged the internet super
    villain!\n\n\nToby I will politely ask you to stop this now. I said my piece,
    I got threatened by a fat guy and you are still continuing to try and make me
    feel \"all bad and stuff\". It really isn't going to happen.\n\n\nBelfast is a
    small place, we all bump into each other. Wouldn't it be a better to ask ME -
    when we all meet - why I am so pissed with Barry Gordon? Or would you rather keep
    up some absurd column with comments which are embarrassing, and to be blunt, bloody
    immature FOR US ALL. Think about it... look at your comments, look at mine. Do
    you truly believe this is degenerating into a complete piece of garbage?\n\n\nI
    do not use social media, I do not use anything which keeps me locked in my home.
    I have a beautiful woman, I have a great life. I can and do what I want and when
    I want so do you honestly, seriously Toby, do you honestly think I am going to
    walk away from here and let it hang on my mind that you 5 or so people are laughing
    at me? hmm... seriously fkn sad.\n\n\nBarry is Barry Gordon. Barry Adams threatened
    me. Simple. I don't take that shit lightly."

    I'll take that as a funny comment, the pleasure is mine ;) It wasn't his SEO, Just click his name, I mean his credentials are everywhere. This is just stupid now.


    Take care Toby and keep up the ramblings. Get something less Barry Gordon up, at least the rant did entertain and maybe we ALL should end this!

    I haven't threatened you at all, you sad coward. In fact, it's you threatening me. Funnily enough, I don't find myself feeling particularly threatened.


    So bring it on. Arrange that meeting - I'll gladly come visit you - and we'll discuss this VERBALLY, like men. At least, one of us will.

    "Do you think I am some internet troll? Do actually really think I am some teenage idiot?"


    Yes, and yes.


    You've never met me, obviously, so your comments about my physical appearance (how mature of you) are forgiveable, if pathetic.


    So let's remedy that, superman. Meet me face to face for a verbal settlement of this rather amusing discussion.

    "Don't threaten me with violence. You haven't a clue what I have achieved. It will result in 2 things, you having a trip to the hospital and me walking away.

    On the record, I have threatened NO ONE with violence."

    hahaha You're an idiot mate. Probably best to know when to shut up.

    have you know I graduated top of my class in the SAS, and I’ve been involved in
    numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am
    trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire UK armed forces.
    You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with
    precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my

    spies across the UK and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare
    for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you
    call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can
    kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only
    am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal
    of the SAS and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off
    the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what
    unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you,
    maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and
    now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you
    and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

    So guys, Toby especially, I would appreciate if you would remove all the negativity, regardless of SEO I believe my beef between Barry and myself is to be kept that way. I publicly made a mistake and now I regret it.


    Barry Adams, after meeting you I can honestly say I respect what you said. You are a genuine guy and have a good nature. We had a little moment, but I think we have more on common than we probably feel otherwise.


    I apologise mate, sincerely. I hope Toby will take the stupid rantings of an upset man down, it's between the people involved and should never have been made public.


    Again, Barry Adams, you're a decent man and make good conversation in light of what we meant to meet for. I hope and wish the best for you and your wife and company. Take care.

    Hey Darran,

    Thanks for your apology.

    I have been thinking a lot about what is the best thing to do with these comments. On the one hand I don't like seeing comments that openly attack both people I respect and myself, but on the other I think we have all established that your rants have painted you in a far worse light than anyone else.

    I didn't get a say when you made random, scathing and inaccurate judgements about my lifestyle. Barry Gordon didn't get a say when you tarnished his name with what I believe to be inaccurate attacks. So frankly you don't get a say in what information stays on my website.
---
<p>Last night I attended what is shamefully only my second Belfast Ruby meetup (for those interested you can read my <a title="My scribbled thoughts on Belfast Ruby’s first meet up." href="http://tosbourn.com/2012/02/events/my-scribbled-thoughts-on-belfast-rubys-first-meet-up/">awesome review of the first ever Belfast Ruby meetup</a>). It was a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/brrygrdn">Barry Gordon</a> about <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>
<p>Vagrant is something I had heard of and was marginally on my list of things I should really try and break my computer with one day, but I had never given it more than a cursory look when someone tweeted it. With this in mind I found Barry's talk incredibly enlightening.</p>
<p>Barry started off by discussing the disconnect between our development environments and our production environments, mainly that we treat our development environments like pets, we care for them, give them names and play favourites (everyone prefers their key-bindings, and good luck pair programming with a damned emacs user!), yet we treat our production environments like cattle - We don't get attached to a particular instance, and when a new instance is spun up we can't really tell it apart from the last one.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1643" align="aligncenter" width="346"]<a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-03-18.58.39.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1643 " src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-03-18.58.39-577x1024.jpg" alt="Here is a pig" width="346" height="614" /></a> Here is a pig</p>
<p>He then went on to say that perhaps we should be treating our development environments in much the same way, which is where Vagrant comes in.</p>
<p>Vagrant essentially lets you provision and spin up a development environment based on a set of instructions from things like chef cookbooks, puppet scripts, bash scripts, etc. This means you can share an environment that will be identical on every persons machine. This helps to avoid 'Works on my machine' style bugs and also stops you from continually forgetting that you need to install version 3.2.1.2.3.4.2 of some library instead of 3.2.1.2.3.4.3.</p>
<p>At the head of the talk Barry made sure to point out that this is something he wants to play more with and that this should very much be treated like an intro but his talk, and the sample scripts he talked through were more than complete for the general use cases and everything seemed simple enough (famous last words) and he was certainly able to answer any questions people had with authority.</p>
<p>All in all it was an excellent talk, it has opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about development machines and has certainly cemented playing about with Vagrant as something on my todo list!</p>
<p>You can view Barry's slides on <a href="http://www.barrygordon.co.uk/an-intro-to-vagrant/#/">his site</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/brrygrdn/an-intro-to-vagrant">github</a>.</p>
<p>I look forward to attending the next <a href="https://twitter.com/belfastruby">Belfast Ruby</a> event.</p>

<p>Turns out there is nothing (as of writing) that I can find online that will integrate Netbeans and Redmine.</p>
<p>Last night I got tired of waiting so began working on a plugin for myself.Â  This was challenging for a couple of reasons, not least that I haven't looked at Java in years.</p>
<p>Hopefully later on tonight I will have a link up to my Github with version 0.1</p>

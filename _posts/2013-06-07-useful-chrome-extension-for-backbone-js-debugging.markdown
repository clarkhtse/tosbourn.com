<p>If you do much work with Backbone.js inevitably you are going to have to end up debugging some silly mistake you have made, I know I have been making about 5000 a second over the past few days.</p>
<p>Luckily I read today that there is a Google Chrome extension out that can help debug Backbone.js issues. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Maluen/Backbone-Debugger">here</a>Â along with an easy to follow installation guide.</p>
<p>One thing the guide does not mention is that you will more than likely need to restart Chrome to get this to work, I know I did.</p>
<p>Whilst it is clearly still in early development, I have already been putting it to use and getting good stuff back from it</p>

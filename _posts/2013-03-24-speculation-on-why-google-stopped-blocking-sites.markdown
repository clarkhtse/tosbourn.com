<p>Recently it has been <a href="http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1210386">announced</a> that Google is to stop allowing people to block websites from their search results.</p>
<p>I have a couple thoughts on why this might be the case;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sites that pay Google lots of money in advertising are being blocked and that probably isn't good for business.</li>
<li>Their suggestion is to download a Chrome extension, which of course requires that you download Google Chrome.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't imagine there is a huge technical overhead in supporting the functionality and it is useful functionality, so I don't think it could be because the functionality isn't being used.</p>

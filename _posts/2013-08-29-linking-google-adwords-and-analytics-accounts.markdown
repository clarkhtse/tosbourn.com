<p>The process for linking Google Adwords and Google Analytics accounts (in my experience) seems to change quite regularly, and unfortunately their documentation isn't being updated as fast as these changes are being rolled out.</p>
<p>So when I had to link two accounts I was surprised that even though I followed the steps outlined inÂ https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2617364?hl=en-GB I wasn't able to see my Analytics property inside of Adwords.</p>
<p>The solution that worked for me at the time of writing is to do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into Analytics</li>
<li>Go to Admin</li>
<li>Select your Account</li>
<li>Click on AdWords Linking</li>
<li>Create a new link to the relevant Adwords account.</li>
<li>Log into Adwords</li>
<li>Select your Account</li>
<li>Click on My Account &gt; Linked Accounts</li>
<li>Select the Analytics account you just linked.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully this will save someone some head scratching.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of buzz today about the first lot of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/announcing-the-firefox-os-developer-preview-phone/">developer phones</a> that are going to support Firefox OS. Personally I can't wait to get my dirty mitts on one and have a play.</p>
<p>You don't have to wait until they are released before you can get stuck in though. There are a couple of ways you can get an emulator running to simulate Firefox OS.</p>
<p>The easiest of these is to download the Firefox plugin. Seriously, that is it.</p>
<p>Search for <em>Firefox OS Simulator</em> and you will find it, simply download it and restart Firefox.</p>
<p>You can then access it from <code>Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; Firefox OS Simulator</code></p>
<p>You can run it with a console for debugging any apps you want to start developing.</p>

<p>Yesterday I watched a video taken from a Google+ hangout and really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Essentially it is three Googlers (Boris Smus, Eric Bidelman, Paul Irish) talking about some of the cool stuff they have been working on. It includes some tips on some JavaScript performance debugging you can do with the soon to be new Chrome dev tools and some other pretty rocking stuff.</p>

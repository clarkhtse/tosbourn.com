<p><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">Nettuts</a> provides some excellent tutorials from time to time and I think the latest one which takes the user <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/canvas-from-scratch-transformations-and-gradients/" target="_blank">through the basics of using Canvas.</a></p>
<p>Apart from gaming I have yet to see a really interesting use for the canvas element but hopefully more people getting exposed to the basics of it will help bread some creativity and some fun things will follow as a result.</p>

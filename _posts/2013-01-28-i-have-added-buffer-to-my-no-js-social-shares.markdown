<p>I am a massive fan of <a href="http://buff.ly/MtjOsk">Buffer</a> for sharing and scheduling social media updates, if you haven't tried it before you really should, it is free and takes seconds to set up.</p>
<p>Today on Twitter I asked @<a href="https://www.twitter.com/bufferapp">bufferapp</a> if they had a way you can send updates to your stream without requiring JavaScript and they got back to me really quickly explaining you could.</p>
<p>I am glad they do, it means I can add in Buffer as a social share button down at the bottom of this post and in my <a href="https://github.com/tosbourn/nojs-socialshare">github repository</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the code to achieve it if you were wondering and didn't want to check out my code.</p>
<p><code>&lt;a href="http://bufferapp.com/add?text=Tosbourn&amp;url=http://tosbourn.com"&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

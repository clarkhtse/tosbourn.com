<p>By default invisible characters (or whitespace characters) are displayed in Sublime Text 2 whenever you make a selection over some text, but occasionally it helps to see all invisible characters.</p>
<p>In order to do this in Sublime you need to open your preferences file (On OSx that is <code>âŒ˜+,</code>) and insert the line <code>"draw_white_space": "all"</code>.</p>
<p>By default it is set to <code>"selection"</code> and the other option is for it to be <code>"off".</code></p>
<h2>Why would you want to show invisible characters?</h2>
<p>The reason I needed to turn on this feature was because I had copied and pasted a line of code from a website into a Ruby file and it had brought across with it some invisible characters, I was scratching my head for an hour trying to figure it before I posted a question to StackOverflow (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/14863720/197302">http://stackoverflow.com/q/14863720/197302</a>) and some kind soul pointed me in the right direction.</p>

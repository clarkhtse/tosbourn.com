  content: Don't forget when the interviewer asks 'do you have any questions' make
    sure to ask what your starting salary will be.  You should keep a reference card
    in your pocket with the average salaries of positions which you can quickly remove
    from your pocket and check to make sure that the offer is within industry standards.  If
    it is not within industry standards you should tell the interviewer this. You
    will impress the interviewer with your rigorous approach.

  content: "Thanks for this Toby, very useful tips and not just for rookies. I have
    had a think of what else I can add - although my advice is more around the softer
    skills:\n\nTell them you want the job! \nIt is not enough just to come across
    well at interview.\nFor all they know you could be interviewing all over town
    or are a “tyre\nkicker” who is just feeling the market out. If you want the job
    then make this\nexplicitly clear – talk about what you really like about the company
    / product\n/ domain and that you would relish this specific opportunity and would
    love a\nchance to be a part of the success.\n\nDissect the job description / personal
    specification. \nGo through each point on the spec and think of two examples to
    use for each to demonstrate your knowledge / experience – if you don’t know then
    as Toby suggested, think of alternatives to give and do look up what you don’t
    know (at the very least be able to express and understanding and a desire to learn).\n\nRead
    your CV.\nSuch a simple thing but knowing your CV inside out is important. In
    particular,\nread over your previous job history in case the interviewer drills
    down into\nanything you mention. Remind yourself of all of the roles and specific
    projects\nwhich you mention (think about your role in them, environment / technologies,\nconsiderations,
    outcomes). \n\nThink about YOU, not WE.\nIt is easy to fall into the trap of saying
    “we did this”, which begs the\nquestion “what was your part?”. Always try to focus
    on what YOU did. You can\nstart an answer from a higher level - set the scene,
    what the project was, who\nwas involved, before then bringing it right down to
    what your own input and\nresponsibilities were. Don’t assume the interviewer knows
    anything about what\nyou have done – take them by the hand and walk them through
    it."

    Thanks for the additional points Chris, all excellent stuff - I hadn't thought about dissecting the job description the way you had mentioned it.

    I also found your point on YOU not WE interesting, I would have actually advised the opposite because I feel that WE makes you sound like more of a team player, certainly I have always referred to companies I have worked for as WE and US as opposed to ME and THEM, but this perhaps isn't a good thing on my part!

    Thanks again!

    Hey Kryptogoloc - Thanks so much for the comment.

    This is indeed an excellent point that you should know what you are worth going into the interview (based on industry standards).

    Having notes is actually another great point, there is no written rule that states you can't bring prepared notes into an interview!

    of the few that helped, instead of being too technical.

<p>In the last two companies I have worked for at one time or another I have been involved in recruiting junior members of staff and I have noticed that sometimes some of them have missed what I would consider key parts of interview preparation.</p>
<p>I think once you have been in the industry long enough you pick up these tips without needing to be formally told, which is potentially why I haven't seen some of these tips laid out online before.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't worry about what you don't know</strong> - Junior Developers are almost never hired based on their domain knowledge, it is taken as a given that they don't have much of that yet.</li>
<li><strong>If the company produces a product, use it</strong> - If the company has a free service (or trial period) then sign up and play about before any interview, if that doesn't really apply then make it obvious that you have looked around anything you could to do with the product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Look at any source code you can</strong> - This will either be from open GitHub repositories or at a very minimum the companies brochure site. Comment on this in the interview and for bonus points talk about potential improvements to the code (something as simple as poorly named classes).</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate a passion for what you do</strong> - The one thing Junior Developers will never have an excuse for is not having any passion for the job. Explain to the interview why you need to be working in this field and show the energy you can bring to the company.</li>
<li><strong>Don't bluff questions</strong> - If we ask you about a particular technology and you know very little about it, say so, and maybe talk about something similar (or ask, is that similar to x, y or z?) <strong>DO NOT</strong> start waffling about something you know is rubbish.</li>
<li><strong>Always have followup questions</strong> - Even if this is your second or third interview at a company, think of something to ask at the end.</li>
<li><strong>Try and find out who is interviewing you</strong> - This is over-simplifying it maybe but as a general rule; Developers want to hear you talk the tech talk, Marketers want to hear that you will do the company proud, Managers want to hear that you are willing to learn and to rise to a challenge. If you are meeting a non-technical CEO and an Account Manager, explaining you know how to do a binary search isn't going to impress them much. (Explaining how you love helping customers and trying to understand their requirements would fair you much better!)</li>
<li><strong>Coding challenges are almost never about the code</strong> - They are about how you explain your thought process and how you communicate your code, we would rather hire someone who forgot the need for curly braces and didn't initialise their variables but can say - "I am called this method foo_bar_baz because I think it is immediately apparent what that means".</li>
</ul>
<p>I genuinely hope this helps, and for mega bonus points if I ever interview you, say you read this blog post, the job will be as good as yours! ;-)</p>

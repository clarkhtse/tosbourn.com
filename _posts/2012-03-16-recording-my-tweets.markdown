<p>I am going to start recording links and things I put on Twitter on somewhere other than Twitter, tech tweets for example will end up here, music related tweets will end up on BornInBlood and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>This is because whilst Twitter is excellent as a massive hosepipe of information, it is very easy to quickly lose on of your own tweets.</p>
<p>For now this will be a quick copy/paste job but in the future I will probably write something to handle all this for me.</p>

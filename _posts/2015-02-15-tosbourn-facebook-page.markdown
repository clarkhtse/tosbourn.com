<p>After much hmming and haaing I have decided to open up a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tosbourn">Facebook Page for tosbourn.com</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2578 size-large" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-15-22.57.47-1024x650.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-02-15 22.57.47" width="474" height="301" /></p>
<p>I enjoy talking tech with people but never felt entirely comfortable sharing tech stuff on my personal Facebook profile. I think this is mainly down to the fact that whilst a few people I am "friends" with on Facebook are into tech, a great deal aren't.</p>
<p>This way I can keep the dev chat flowing amongst us strange few that really enjoy that type of stuff without subjecting my family and non-tech friends to blog posts that are meaningless to them.</p>
<p>As well as sharing my own content on there from both tosbourn.com and other sites I write for I will also be sharing great tech links that I find in general, I hope it will turn into a useful resource for people.</p>
<p>Right now I have no plans to automate any sharing to it, it will just be as and when I have something cool to share. I also won't be heavily promoting the page as it is something I want to grow naturally over time.</p>
<h2>Getting it out of my system</h2>
<p>I think that between it and my Twitter profile (where I have always felt comfortable talking tech, that is what I use Twitter for) I should be able to get most of the tech stuff out of my system!</p>
<h2>But David Walsh does it!</h2>
<p>I wasn't really sure if developers did this type of thing but then I stumbled across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidwalshblog">David Walsh's Facebook</a> page I have a lot of respect for him and have followed his <a href="https://twitter.com/davidwalshblog">Twitter page</a> for a while. There are clearly enough people getting value out of his Facebook page so I figure there must be some desire for it.</p>
<h2>If you are on Facebook â€“ Give me a "like"</h2>
<p>So please, if you are on Facebook and into tech, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tosbourn">give me a like</a>, what harm could it do? :-)</p>

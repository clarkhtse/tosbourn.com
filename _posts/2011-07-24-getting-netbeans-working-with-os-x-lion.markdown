    I finally upgraded to Lion and was surprised to see Netbeans stop working.  Thanks for your post.  It did the trick.

<p>One of the few things I needed to mess around with to get working when I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion was Netbeans.</p>
<p>Very basically Lion doesn't ship with Java, and Netbeans obviously needs Java installed to work.</p>
<p>You would have thought this would have been a simple case of just going onto the Java website and grabbing a download link, but unfortunately they haven't updated their downloads and for OS X it just says to get it from your OS (which was true up until Lion).</p>
<p>Instead the page you should visit is a <a title="Download for Java" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421">download for Java</a> hosted on the apple site.</p>
<p>Download the .dmg file, run it, then try and open up Netbeans, it should just automatically work.</p>
<p>Jobs a goodun'</p>

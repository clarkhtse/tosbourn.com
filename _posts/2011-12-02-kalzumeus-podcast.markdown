<p>I have to say I am very glad that I did, woah they packed a lot of stuff into around 80 minutes.   Here are some of the topics they covered;</p>
<ul>
<li>Software development in Japan.</li>
<li>A/B testing</li>
<li>Career advice for developers (or not developers)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was enjoyable and informative and has made it onto my podcast list.</p>

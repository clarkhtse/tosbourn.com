<p>If you have visited my site for any length of time you will know that I have had quite a few dealings with Packt Publishing. I wanted to write up a quick post explaining why that is the case!</p>
<h2>I reviewed for Packt Publishing</h2>
<p>A very long time ago I was contacted by Packt Publishing by the always friendly Kenny Dias to write a review for <a title="Review: Mastering Redmine" href="http://tosbourn.com/review-mastering-redmine/">Mastering Redmine</a>. At the time I was using Redmine a lot and felt I would be in a good position to offer up my thoughts.</p>
<p>I was given access to the book on their site and I enjoyed the process of reading and reviewing the book. Kenny seemed to like how responsive I was and continued to offer me books. I only ever picked books that I felt I would be able to provide a fair review for. As someone who loves to read tech books it was a complete win win and I was super happy to continue with this arrangement.</p>
<p>If you are interested the reason I was approached it because I blogged about Redmine, not even in that much depth or frequency but clearly enough to be noticed by someone!</p>
<h2>I wrote for Packt Publishing</h2>
<p>Unrelated (I think) to my reviewing work that I was continuing to do for Packt Publishing I was writing about some issues I was having with <a title="Using Bootstrapâ€™s typeahead from inside a modal window" href="http://tosbourn.com/using-bootstraps-typeahead-from-inside-a-modal-window/">Bootstrap's Typeahead functionality</a>. Again the blog post was read by someone at Packt and I was contacted to see if I would like to write a book about <a title="Typeahead.js The Book!" href="http://tosbourn.com/typeahead-js-the-book/">Twitter's Typeahead project</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are seeing a theme about blogging increasing your luck surface area, you are right, I have written about how <a title="Good things happen to those that blog" href="http://tosbourn.com/good-things-happen-blog/">good things happen to those who blog</a> before and stand by it.</p>
<h2>I reviewed again for Packt Publishing!</h2>
<p>I was actually still writing the Typeahead book when I was asked if I wanted to review some things again, and due to an administrative blip when my book was out I was asked if I wanted to review it.</p>
<p>If you are interested I would have given it 5/5 :-)</p>
<p>I didn't think they would ever want me to write again, I was honoured to be asked the first time but figured they wouldn't want to do it again. Once my book was out I started reviewing their content again.</p>
<h2>I *almost* wrote again for Packt Publishing</h2>
<p>Some time later I was contacted to see if I wanted to write a much bigger book for Packt Publishing, for some reason someone in there liked me and thought I did a good enough job to see if I wanted to write a 300 page book on jQuery.</p>
<p>Initially I jumped at the chance but had to let them down pretty early in the process. I have depression and unfortunately shortly after accepting the wonderful task of writing this book my depression took a bit of a turn for the worst and I knew there was no way I was going to be able to deliver anything even slightly good for them.</p>
<h2>I continue to review for Packt Publishing</h2>
<p>Amazingly Packt didn't sever all ties with me after that and to this day I still review for them, I am sure they will never ask me to write again for them but to be honest I am happy to keep on reviewing their amazing catalogue of content.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I get no money for reviewing these books, and I am never coerced into writing something positive I don't believe in.</p>

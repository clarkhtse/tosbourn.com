<p>This is something I am continually guilty of, writing something, giving it a quick read over and then immediately posting it up. This isn't a good idea and it leads to lower quality content being produced and potentially ill conceived ideas being aired.</p>
<p>Obviously in some situations there is an advantage to being first to market, and this applies to blog posts as well. If you are writing about some form of breaking news or writing a 'live blog' about something then it would make good sense to ignore this post, but for most other types of writing I think you would benefit from taking a break between writing and publishing.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">During the time you finish writing and the time you publish you might come up with a new idea or angle to explore in the post.</span></li>
<li>Grammatical and spelling errors are easier to pick up with fresh eyes.</li>
<li>Social media along with sites like Reddit and Hacker News mean your post could be being seen by thousands of people within minutes, so you don't have the luxury of making small incremental changes after you post.</li>
<li>You might think of better wording for something or a more eloquent way to write it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have read some people like to wait a week or more before revisiting a body work, I have done this before but I haven't found that any more effective than just leaving it for a day or two. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>It also helps to steady your output, I for one have this massive creative surge for writing at around 11PM at night, depending on the length of the post I could have it written and proof-read by midnight, even if it was good to go and I didn't think anything could be added it to this would not a good time to post, holding off means I have content that I can share at more opportune times.</p>

<p>If you have crafted your website or app from scratch and poured your soul into it you are not going to want to hear this next line.</p>
<p><strong> Marketing is more important than your code.</strong></p>
<p>It is sad but true that the vast majority of people will make a purchasing decision based more on the marketing than the quality of a product.</p>
<p>What this means for your website is that if you only have 3 hours a week to spend on it you might be better spent working on the marketing than you are on a new feature.</p>

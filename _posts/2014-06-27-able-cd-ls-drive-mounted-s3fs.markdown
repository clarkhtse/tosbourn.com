<p>Earlier I was playing with S3FS to mount an Amazon S3 instance as a drive on a linux machine.</p>
<p>The mount appeared to work correctly but I experienced some issues around navigating around the mounted drive, some investigation showed that the files and folders that were coming from Amazon where all down as being owned by root.</p>
<p>This shouldn't have been the case.</p>
<p>The fix I used was to pass the user ID and group ID into the parameters that the mount used within <code>/etc/fstab</code>.</p>
<p>This is what my <code>/etc/fstab</code> looked like;</p>
<pre>s3fs#my_mount /mnt/my_mount fuse allow_other,uid=1000,default_acl=public-read,gid=1000 0 0</pre>
<p>In the above then uid is the user ID you want to associate the mount with and gid is the group.</p>
<p>In Ubuntu to find the user ID I normally run <code>cat /etc/passwd</code> which lists all the users and their IDs and to get the group ID I run <code>cat /etc/group</code> which displays all the groups along with their IDs.</p>

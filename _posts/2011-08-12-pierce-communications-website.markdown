<p>Today the <a title="Pierce Communications" href="http://www.piercecommunications.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pierce Communications</a> website went live.  This is cool for a handful of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is my first project to go live as a developer at Pierce.</li>
<li>This was my first project working closely with a full time in-house designer.</li>
<li>I had to dig around WordPress more than I have had to in the past.</li>
<li>The old site was holding us back and seemed to be a bit of a weight around the office, hopefully now we can surge forward with a couple of things.</li>
</ul>
<p>The website was 80% there before I took over so essentially I was tasked with all the fiddly tidying up that needs to happen when a web project is nearing completion.</p>
<p>There were some interesting challenges like bringing our old posts into this new structure and making changes that kept all concerned happy (not just designers, but marketing / SEO / etc. peeps)</p>
<p>Any feedback you have on the site would be very much appreciated - we are pushing to make monthly improvements/changes we want to keep it as organic as possible.</p>
<p>Working in this new environment with these excellent people has been such a massive but awesome learning curve.  Hopefully there will be many more go lives to come!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cssupdater.com" target="_blank">cssUpdater</a> is a plugin for <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">Firebug</a> which allows you to automatically save changes made in Firebug to your CSS file, which is going to be a massive time saver for me.</p>
<p>I found this when I was doing a quick search for new CSS themed Firefox plugins and whilst I was initially put off by the fact I had to install Adobe Air on my lovely new machine and the fact I had to sign up to a website in order to use this service I decided to give it a whirl.  After doing those things the process of using it was fairly straight forward.</p>
<p>You download and install the Air application, put in your key (which you can get from the website by clicking on your username once logged in), drag your local CSS file into the Air application and there you go, set up and ready to sync.</p>
<p>Once you have made your edit in Firebug you can sync either from the Firebug console itself, or from the Air application.</p>
<p>To sum up this very quick post I think my initial thoughts on this small app are very promising ones.  Get over the fact you need to sign up in order to use it and you will very quickly find yourself saving a lot of time copying and pasting small code changes.</p>
<p>The creators seem very keen to receive feedback and hopefully this app will continue to improve with each release.</p>

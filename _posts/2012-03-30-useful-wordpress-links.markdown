    The fourth link down is broken: "Useful WordPress Themes, Tools and Plugins." I am looking for something in particular, so I tried that link... (I ended up finding it anyway through Google, just wanted to mention.)

    Side-note: do you know an easy plugin/way to include raw HTML into a WordPress public page? Really it can be dead simple - I just don't know WordPress that well, and need to embed raw HTML (without WP changing or messing it up) and have it displayed. (It is an HTML form that I want to embed.)

    Thanks!

    Hey,

    Thanks for the heads up - I will fix that link now.

    To add HTML just in the edit mode of the page click on the HTML view - anything you paste in there will be recognised as HTML and allowed into the page.

    In edit mode press CTRL/CMD+F to get "find" up and type HTML if you can't see it.

    Maybe I am not understanding correctly, if not let me know!

    Cheers,
    Toby

  content: Sorry, I did not clarify... it is actually not for a blog post - it would
    be for a sidebar/template item. So static stuff that is part of the template,
    and not an actual post... Thanks for your help!

    1) Embed it as part of the theme (you can edit theme files from Appearance

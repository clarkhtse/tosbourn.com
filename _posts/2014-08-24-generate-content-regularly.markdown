<p>It is cliche but content really is king on the web and if you want a good brand or presence online you need to be generating it regularly.</p>
<p>Note that regularly doesnâ€™t mean frequently, it means regularly. If you think you can commit to one blog post a month, make sure there is always one blog post a month going out. If you think you can commit to 4 Facebook updates a day, make sure there are always 4 Facebook updates a day.</p>
<p>Having regular content helps you build up a head of steam and as you get more and more content it is easier to find ways to make people stay on your site longer, it also gets you into the habit of committing a certain amount of time each month/week/day to your project.</p>
<p>Having said that, never generate content just for the sake of generating content, make sure it is quality, genuinely useful or interesting for your readers.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to outsource your content, that is always an option although I have had some mixed results in doing it. If you can find someone who is excellent and at a reasonable price then I say go for it.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend jumping between different branches too often when you are deploying, it is too easy to forget which branch you actually want to deploy and that could beÂ disastrous, but on occasion it just makes sense.</p>
<p>The command you need to run would be something like this;</p>
<p><code>ey deploy -e demo -r my_awesome_branch</code></p>
<p><code>ey</code> just calls engine yard, <code>deploy</code> tells engine yard that we want to deploy something, <code>-e</code> tells it what environment to deploy it to, and <code>-r</code> is optional and stands for ref, this tells engine yard which branch, tag or SHA to deploy.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I was talking about how I had <a href="http://www.tosbourn.com/2010/04/web-stuff/uptime-robot/">started using Uptime Robot</a>, a tool for monitoring websites uptime.  Although it is obviously early days yet I have found the service to be excellent thus far and would be more than happy to recommend them to people.</p>
<p>They sent an email out yesterday explaining that they are going to start monitoring your websites from multiple locations - this is really cool and really adds some extra value to the service in my opinion.  You can read more about this enhancement on the <a href="http://blog.uptimerobot.com/multi-location-monitoring-and-new-ips/">official Uptime Robot blog</a>.</p>

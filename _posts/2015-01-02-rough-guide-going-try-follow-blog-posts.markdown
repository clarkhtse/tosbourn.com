<p class="p1">As you may have read recently I am trying to do more online writing by committing to making <a href="/365-articles-2015/%20‎">365 posts in 2015</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the things I quickly realised is that I should really get a plan in place that helps me move from my notes and thoughts on a subject to an actual useful post.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Things I am going to do before writing posts</h2>
<p>I have written before about how I sometimes generate ideas using a <a href="/how-i-use-mindnode-to-help-craft-blog-posts/">mind map</a>, that isn't what I am going to talk about here, this is the stage after I have had the idea but before I have committed anything to paper.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Make sure I have enough to say on the matter – If it is more like a single thought I will likely just post it on <a href="https://twitter.com/tosbourn">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://ello.co/tosbourn">Ello</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Research other posts on the subject – It might be that the subject is insanely well covered, if I have nothing to get off my chest I would then likely again post a link somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1">Things I am going to do after writing the first draft</h2>
<p>I am in two minds if some of the stuff I mention here shouldn't be done earlier in the process. I might adjust these over time.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Search for good quotes – Because everyone likes a good quote!</li>
<li class="p1">Search for interesting images – I don't want to add images for the sake of it, but if I can find something relevant I will add it.</li>
<li class="p1">Ask an expert their opinion – If I can get a one liner from someone that would be amazing.</li>
<li class="p1">Ask for quotes from users/non-experts – This will depend heavily on the subject matter, but I think it could be really useful to have different views scattered throughout the post.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things I am going to do once the post is complete</h2>
<p>This part of my workflow really needs a lot of work, I do very little work post publishing a post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross link it with anything relevant I have written before – I am really bad at doing this and I think as a result readers might miss out on something they may find interesting.</li>
<li>Promote the article on my social media feeds – More importantly is to do this more than once.</li>
<li>Respond to feedback – From comments on the article itself or on social media/email.</li>
</ul>

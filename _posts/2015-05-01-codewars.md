[Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/r/ybxxrw) is a fun way to learn the fundamentals of several different programming languages by completing small atomic tasks.

## Katas

The challenges range from fairly dry maths questions to hugely elaborate stories where your code will provide the solution the hero needs!

`8KYU` is the easiest level and the majority of these will teach you core principals and structures.

By `1KYU` you will be tackling larger computer science style programs in your chosen language.

Many of the challenges (called Katas) are written in more than one language. One thing I enjoy doing is solving a problem in one language and then seeing how I would implement it differently in another one.

## Why?

Learning like this is really fun, because you are not working on a project with additional issues you are able to focus your mind on the smaller problems. This can really help you understand how a language works and how to think/write the solutions cleanly.

## Contributing

I havenâ€™t done this yet but the questions are all community based and you can take part in creating your own or contributing to existing questions. I think this would be a fun thing to do after I have progressed some more within the site.

## Come play!

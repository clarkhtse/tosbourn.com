  content: 'Three things: (1) Sure, but the rank-and-file who aren''t into website
    development may not be using HTML, and spending the time to copy-and-paste an
    ellipsis can be a waste of time better spent working on the document in other
    ways. (2) I''ve seen some fonts where the ellipsis is too cramped and downright
    ugly. (3) Your point that "it makes no sense to end the sentance [sic] three times"
    is rather pedantic; I don''t think anyone interprets it as "three full stops,"
    but as an easy way to make an ellipsis when the keyboard doesn''t have one.'

    Hey J.R, cheers for the comments;


    1) I don't think using proper grammar is a waste of time.
    2) That is an issue for the font foundry or the person choosing the fonts.
    3) Agreed, that is pedantic of me.

<p>Hopefully to most people reading this I will be preaching to the converted but I still see so many examples of people using three full stops instead of '…'.</p>
<p>This is a problem because one of these is a character that indicates text or a section of text is missing from a greater body of text and one of these is a series of full stops.</p>
<p>A full stop is generally used to show that a sentance has ended, one is always enough, it makes no sense to end the sentance three times.</p>
<p>There is the (weak) arugment that they look the same so there is no need to worry, O and 0 under some lights look the same, doesn't mean that they have anything to do with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Why I am mentioning this in a tech blog?</strong></p>
<p>Because a lot of the time we need to limit the amount of text that gets returned from a function for layout or practical reasons and when we chop off text it is best practice to somehow inform the user of this.</p>
<p>One way of achieving this is to end the sentance and put something like 'Read More' another way is to add the trailing dots (ellipses).</p>
<p>There are some accessibility implications that come along with using three full stops as opposed to the correct character, screen readers can be set to read out the character (in my experience calling it a 'period') obviously this isn't right.</p>
<p>The other implication (in my opinion) is it shows a lazy handle of the language, you wouldn't puncuate you wouldn't replace the full stop for a comma or an open bracket for a semi-colon, so why would you replace the ellipsis with three full stops?</p>
<p><strong>How do I use the ellipsis character?</strong></p>
<p>In HTML you can write &amp;hellip; or &amp;#0133;</p>
<p><strong>What do I do if I see a website using three full stops instead of the ellipsis?</strong></p>
<p>Email them a link to here telling them to wise up and start doing things right!</p>

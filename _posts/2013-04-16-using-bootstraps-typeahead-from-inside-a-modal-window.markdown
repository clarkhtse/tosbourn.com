    Simpler from boostrap issue number 1078:

    .typeahead.dropdown-menu { z-index: 200000; }
    .modal-body{overflow-y: inherit;}

    I hope this help,
    Mike

<p>If you want to use bootstrap's typeahead functionality from inside a modal window such as lightbox or facebox then you are probably going to have to make a small edit to one of the bootstrap files.</p>
<p>Open upÂ <code>bootstrap-typeahead.js</code> in your text editor of choice and then add a <code>z-index</code> of 9999, like so;</p>
<pre><code>  this.$menu.css({
    top: pos.top + pos.height,
    left: pos.left,
    'z-index': 9999
  })</code></pre>
<p>You probably don't need to go as high as 9999 but it worked for me!</p>
<p>It took me way too long to get this working, other bootstrap things appear to work fine inside modals.</p>

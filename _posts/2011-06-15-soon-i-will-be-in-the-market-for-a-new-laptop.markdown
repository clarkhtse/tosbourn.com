<p>Pretty soon I am going to be in the market for a new laptop to use for casual surfing and web development.  I am torn between three different options and would love some feedback/opinions.</p>
<ol>
<li>My first thought was to get a <a title="MacBook" href="http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook" target="_blank">MacBook</a>, that is what I am currently using.  I like OS X and enjoy developing on it.  The major downside is cost £867 is very steep and once you are spending that type of money I may as well start looking at <a title="MacBook Pro" href="http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_pro?mco=MTM3NDc0NDI" target="_blank">MacBook Pros</a>, an extra £140 would get me an entry level one.</li>
<li>Next on my list is to buy a <a title="ChromeBook" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-3G-Chromebook-Arctic-White/dp/B0054WOVRW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308165810&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">ChromeBook</a>, I had no idea they were even due to be released yet but <a title="Jonathan Kelly Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/JonathanKelly50" target="_blank">Jonathan Kelly</a> was telling me about it today. On the plus side it is new and gadgety and has built in support for 3G internet on the down side I have no idea how it could handle any sort of web development, I don't know enough about their offline abilities and if they have the potential for running anything other than Chromium.  At £400 it would be a steal compared to the Macs.</li>
<li>The third and final option is to get a standard (probably Dell) laptop, haven't thought too much about exact specs (since I don't game the only thing I really look for is a decent enough processor and at least 2GB of RAM).  A quick look brought me a <a title="Dell XPS 15 Laptop" href="http://www.dell.com/uk/p/xps-l502x/pd?oc=n00x5m11&amp;model_id=xps-l502x" target="_blank">Dell XPS 15 Laptop</a> which looks nice.  At £679 it is middle of the road between the ChromeBook and a Macbook, has everything I would want spec wise but I would need to check I could install Ubuntu on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am pretty average with hardware and any advice would be well received!</p>

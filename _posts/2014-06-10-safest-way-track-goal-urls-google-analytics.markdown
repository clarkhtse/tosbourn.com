<p>I was recently digging into some analytics and I wondered why a goal I was tracking had stopped working, I decided to do some digging.</p>
<p>Turns out that I was looking for a page being hit with my destination being set to "<strong>Equals to</strong>" and passing in the page I was expecting. For example;</p>
<p>Destination URL Equals To: <code>/thank-you-for-your-order/</code></p>
<p>For ages this worked like a charm, but recently the task that would send people to that page started adding some extra parameters to the URL, so the URL getting hit was <code>/thank-you-for-your-order/?foo=bar</code>.</p>
<p>This does not trigger my event because <code>/thank-you-for-your-order/?foo=bar</code> â‰  <code>/thank-you-for-your-order/</code></p>
<p>The safer thing to do is actually something that to some folk my appear scary, that is to use the Regular Expression option.</p>
<h2>Changing Equals To to Regular Expression in Google Analytics</h2>
<p>For something simple like my use case the conversion is painfully simple, I needed to change to Regular Expression and change the input to;</p>
<p><code>^\/thank-you-for-your-order\/</code></p>
<p>The ^ says the following stuff needs to appear at the start of the URL and all the \ is doing is letting the Regular Expression know to not treat the / as anything special and that it is part of the string we care about.</p>
<p>If you want to convert yours and are having a hard time please just leave a comment and I can take a look!</p>

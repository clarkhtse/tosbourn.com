<p>I have been meaning to post something for a while as almost a heads up for anyone searching for Citalopram and Green Tea!</p>
<p>You are not alone, I too feel very ill if I take Green Tea tablets!</p>
<p>I was doing some research and according to a couple of sources, including <a href="https://online.epocrates.com/u/104496/citalopram/Drug+Interactions">Epocrates Online</a>, Green Tea is listed as something to use with caution.</p>
<p>I have made the mistake of taking Green Tea tablets twice since being on Citalopram and I would not recommend it, both times I have felt incredibly sick, almost like the feeling you get with food poisoning, and started to sweat an absolute tonne.</p>
<p>I am unaware of anything Green Tea like that I could take that wouldn't leave me feeling sick, if you are aware of anything please let me know in the comments!</p>

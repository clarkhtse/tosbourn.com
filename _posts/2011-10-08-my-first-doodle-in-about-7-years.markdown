<p>Today I bought a <a href="http://www.wacom.eu/index2.asp?pid=294&amp;spid=3" target="_blank">Wacom Bamboo</a> tablet;</p>
<p>This is my first attempt at using it.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Untitled-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-598" title="Untitled 2" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Untitled-2-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I used to draw these little guys when I was bored during class.  I want to get better at drawing / creating graphics and hopefully charging about on this tablet will help me.  There is also built in hand writing recognition, which could be fun to play with.</p>
<p>I don't think the design team at <a href="http://www.piercecommunications.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pierce</a> have much to worry about just yet, but who knows?</p>

  content: It is really informative and valuable document.

<p>So the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> have recently released a document entitled <a title="Web Application Privacy Best Practices document" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-app-privacy-bp-20110804/" target="_blank">Web Application Privacy Best Practices</a>, which I have to say I am more than happy about.</p>
<p>I really think that with most things in life, if you can follow a best practice (and so long as that best practice is sound) then you won't go far wrong.</p>
<p>So I guess the first question I have to ask is, is this document sound? Well, of course it is, it is written by some of the smartest people in our industry and a lot of thought has went into it.</p>
<p>As it is the first public working draft we cannot expect the content to stay nailed down exactly as it is but I don't think it would be jumping the gun to begin implementing those best practices mentioned in it.</p>
<p>Having read through the document a couple of times I don't think there is anything too ground breaking in it, if you are a thoughtful web developer who tries to keep the end user happy then you are probably doing most of these things anyway.</p>
<p>One of the items I personally need to put more thought into is…</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-app-privacy-bp-20110804/"><p>Best Practice 9: Retain the minimum amount of data at the minimum level of detail for the minimum amount of time needed. Consider potential misuses of retained data and possible countermeasures.</p></blockquote>
<p>I try and maintain the minimum amount of data, but I never really consider how long I need that data for, any tips you have on how to judge this type of thing I would love to hear about in the comments or on <a href="http://twitter.com/tosbourn" target="_blank">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>One thing I think is maybe missing from this document is some clarification and extended examples on some of the points, a lot of the points are left fairly open ended and open to interpretation which sometimes they need to be but perhaps some more examples and use cases would be beneficial. I think currently the document is open enough that developers could be making decisions in the spirit of the document but missing the point on some of the practices.</p>
<p>I will be following the steps outlined in the document for commenting - I suggest if you have any comments on it you do the same.</p>
<p>To wrap up then, I am glad a document like this has surfaced, it will make my life easier when making decisions and if the majority of web owners followed them it might make the world a better place!</p>

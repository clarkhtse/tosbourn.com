  content: Thanks for sharing this, I am also not in favor of using (loading, external
    reference, etc) the JS option. I'm curious if you can say what 20% of things your
    example doesn't cover, since you mentioned 80%.

    Hey Tarek,


    Thanks for commenting - That was a finger in the air type number, but things it doesn't cover are things like reporting how many shares you have had on the page and any unique stuff each social network adds to their JS.

<p>I have blogged before about having <a href="http://tosbourn.com/2013/01/development/replacing-social-media-share-buttons-with-non-javascript-counterparts/">social share buttons without JavaScript</a>, I just wanted to do a quick followup post to show off three things.</p>
<p>The first is that I have implemented them on this site, you can go ahead and test them out by sharing any number of my articles.</p>
<p>The second is that I have added share buttons for both Reddit and Hacker News, I think these qualify as social networks and warranted the addition.</p>
<p>Finally, I have made a github repository called <a href="https://github.com/tosbourn/nojs-socialshare">nojs-socialshare</a> to share the code I used when creating these buttons, feel free to fork and add your own.</p>

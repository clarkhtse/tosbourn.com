<p>One of the things we have been working on at Rumble Labs is a project called <a href="https://nuu.in">Nuu</a>. I have been meaning to write a post for a while about how useful I have genuinely found it.</p>
<p>Nuu is a platform to allow you to discover and share new places to check out, they could be shops, bars, restaurants or things like tech co-working spaces. The core thing is that they are new places, our weighting system for what order we show stuff to people in reflects this.</p>
<p>So, things first. I probably do need a more clear disclaimer, I work as a developer for Rumble Labs and have worked on Nuu. Naturally I have a vested interest in seeing it succeed.</p>
<p>That being said, I actually remember telling <a href="http://nuu.in/users/shylands">Steven</a> when Nuu was first being worked on that someone like me would not be a user of the site. I thought the idea of finding and sharing new things was boring and that places like Facebook and Twitter that I already used would highlight anything worth checking out.</p>
<p>Turns out I was wrong to dismiss Nuu in those early days and I have become a heavy user of the site outside of work hours.</p>
<h2>Features I really like about Nuu</h2>
<p>There are three features that I really love about Nuu which I will talk about in turn.</p>
<h3>Email Notifications by City</h3>
<p>There are a few different ways you can set your email notifications up (including not having any, if you wanted).</p>
<p>The way I have mine set up is that I get one daily notification if anyone has added a new place in London to check out and I get a weekly digest of anything in London opening up in the week ahead.</p>
<p>What I love about these is that they are completely passive – I don't have to do anything to find out about cool stuff to check out. And when the email comes in it is super quick to scan, open up the things I might be interested in and ignore the rest. There is incredibly little time investment in it.</p>
<h3>Being able to add stuff to a to visit list</h3>
<p>When the emails come in and I click into a few cool sounding places I can easily mark them as somewhere I want to visit, this adds them to a <a href="https://nuu.in/users/tosbourn">to visit list</a>.</p>
<p>What I love about this list is the very second you are chatting with someone about where to go on Saturday or what to do tonight, you have a place where you have been adding cool places to check out.</p>
<p>Better yet, if your friend is on Nuu and they have been adding places to check out why not suggest somewhere you <strong>know</strong> they want to go? Such an easy way to make decisions!</p>
<h3>Commenting on stuff</h3>
<p>The final feature I like is commenting on stuff, this is hardly a ground breaking bit of technology but one of the problems you might have with checking out a new place is that it might be terrible, or it might have potential but for the first month might have teething problems.</p>
<p>These niggling thoughts can either be confirmed or ignored easily by seeing if people have commented positively or negatively on something.</p>
<p>The fact you can @mention folk in comments is great as well, it means you can actually discuss a place right there on the page. This is a relatively new feature that was added but already you can see great conversations happening between folk.</p>
<h2>Places I have found because of Nuu</h2>
<p>Here are some places I wanted to call out as great things I would never have known about if it wasn't for Nuu.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nuu.in/places/den-udon">Den Udon</a> – I love noodles and want to check this place out</li>
<li><a href="https://nuu.in/places/blackchapel">The Black Chapel</a> – A great sounding coffee place</li>
<li><a href="https://nuu.in/places/bunnychow">BunnyChow</a> – South African food served in bread bowls</li>
<li><a href="https://nuu.in/places/draughts">Draughts</a> – A place to drink and play games</li>
</ul>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>So that was my post on things I really love about <a href="https://nuu.in">Nuu</a>.</p>
<p>It isn't really my place to be announcing any thoughts or plans for the future on my personal blog but one of the great things about this being such a young project is that if you wanted you could make a difference to what this projects grows into.</p>
<p>Any comments left here I will filter back to the folk in the office and you can always get in touch on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whatsnuu">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/whatsnuu">Twitter</a> pages.</p>

<p>Today is my first day of playing with the postgres commandline client psql.</p>
<p>My first task was completed (renaming a database) and I wanted to leave the client.</p>
<p>The answer is to type <code>\q</code>, as a Postgres novice this was non-obvious!</p>
<p>Things that did not work;</p>
<ul>
<li>quit</li>
<li>exit</li>
<li>Ctrl+C</li>
<li>sadlfjdsljsdfs</li>
<li>die</li>
</ul>

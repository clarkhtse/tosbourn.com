Like most people I use my personal Github account for work projects and for projects where I am contributing as part of an organisation of people.

One thing I have never loved is that if I was subscribed to an issue or a repository that I would get emails to my personal email. 

I don’t check my personal email regularly throughout the working day so I would often miss things.  Likewise I don’t like my personal email being cluttered up with something I might not necessarily want to think about when I am checking personal mail.

## Custom Routing of Github Emails

Luckily there is a solution.

* Set up all the emails you want to associate with your Github account, you do so in the [email settings page](https://github.com/settings/emails).
* Confirm any email addresses you have added. You will receive an email with a link to click on.
* Go to the [notifications settings page](https://github.com/settings/notifications) and for each organisation you are a member of, set the email address you wish to receive emails from. You will see these options under **Custom Routing**.

I am much happier now I have changed these settings.

<p>When I first started using Sublime Text 2 I was a little taken back at the apparent awkwardness of setting up plugins, or packages as they are natively called.</p>
<p>My apprehension was misguided because installing packages is incredibly easy.</p>
<p>There are a handful of package managers you can use for Sublime Text 2 but today I am going to talk about installing a package that you found on Github or some other place where all you have are the source files.</p>
<p>First we need to find a package, as an example lets use this <a href="https://github.com/purplefish32/sublime-text-2-wordpress">WordPress snippet plugin</a>, we need to download or clone it onto our machine - if you download the zipped version you should extract it before continuing.</p>
<p>Now from within Sublime Text 2 you should go to Preferences &gt; Browse Packages, a window should appear that houses all your packages.</p>
<p>Next we need to find where the folder is we just downloaded and drag it into the package directory.</p>
<p>That is it! In this instance we didn't have to restart Sublime Text 2 but I have seen some packages that require it.</p>

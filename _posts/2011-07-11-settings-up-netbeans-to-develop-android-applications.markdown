<p>If you want to set up Netbeans to allow you to develop Android applications there are three places I suggest you visit.</p>
<p>The first is where you can pick up the <a title="Android SDK" href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">official SDK</a> for your OS. Â It will also walk you through setting up Eclipse, but that isn't the IDE I use and I didn't want to install it just for Android projects.</p>
<p>The second place I think you should go is to an old blog post discussing getting <a href="http://gerry.ws/2009/01/1074/how-to-setup-netbeans-for-android-development.html" target="_blank">Netbeans Setup to play with Android</a>, whilst it was written in 2009 the links from it are accurate and the information sound.</p>
<p>Finally if you get stuck setting up the SDK I would suggest watching the following YouTube video; It is assuming a Windows based OS but the guide is easily transferable to other operating systems.</p>

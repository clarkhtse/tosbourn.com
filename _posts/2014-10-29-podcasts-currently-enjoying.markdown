<p>I have been really enjoying reading various folks on Twitter talking about their current podcast subscriptions. Namely <a href="http://www.canicula.com/wp/?p=1431">Ian Robinson's </a>and <a href="http://www.christopherlaughlin.co.uk/2014/10/27/podcasts/">Chris Laughlin's</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted in!</p>
<p>Update – I have made an <a href="http://tosbourn.com/podcasts-enjoying-update/">update post</a> about some of these podcasts.</p>
<h2>Podcasts I am currently enjoying</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/">Smart Passive Income</a> — A podcast on the topic of making money online. Pat Flynn is a very smart man and is very easy to listen to. He has some great guests on as well. (He actually got a mention on a post <a href="http://tosbourn.com/resources-making-website-pay/">I wrote before</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/category/the-tim-ferriss-show/">The Tim Ferriss Show</a> — I have talked about the Tim Ferriss show before, super powerful stuff. His shows are split between deep interviews and smaller essay reads. Read my post entitled <a href="http://tosbourn.com/tim-ferriss-show-might-important-podcast-listen/">The Tim Ferriss Show Might be the Most Important Podcast I Listen to</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/">The Skeptics Guide to the Universe</a> — A panel show taking a skeptical look at current affairs, funny and illuminating.</li>
<li><a href="http://tosbourn.com/stacking-the-founder-chips-in-your-favour/">Startups for the Rest of Us</a> — A great podcast about bootstrapping and startups in general. Both Rob Walling and Mike Taber are deep in the trenches and every episode as actionable insight. I actually wrote a blog post based on one of their episodes. <a href="http://tosbourn.com/stacking-the-founder-chips-in-your-favour/">Stacking the founder chips in your favour</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> — A podcast by Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann, it is a little bit of productivity, work, communication, comics, and a serious amount of laughs. This is the podcast I make sure to listen to every episode of.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/timc">The Infinite Monkey Cage</a> — A panel show with Robin Ince and Bryan Cox, a funny look at science. Great fun and I learn something each episode!</li>
</ul>

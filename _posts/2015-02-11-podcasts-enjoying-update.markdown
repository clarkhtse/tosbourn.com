<p>Since the last time I wrote about <a title="Podcasts I am currently enjoying" href="http://tosbourn.com/podcasts-currently-enjoying/">podcasts I listen to</a> my regular must listen to list has changed.</p>
<h2>Podcasts I am not really listening to anymore</h2>
<p>There are a couple of podcasts that made my first list that I no longer listen to regularly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Passive Income</strong> – I still think it is a great show but there was a run of episodes that I felt didn't really applied to me so it kind of dropped off my radar. I am still subscribed but I very much cherry pick which ones I will listen to.</li>
<li><strong>The Skeptics Guide to the Universe</strong> – I was getting increasingly bored with their discussions. They spent too much time laughing at idiots, which grew old quick and was providing less and less value or entertainment for me.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New podcasts I am listening to</h2>
<p>I am enjoying these four new podcasts quite a bit.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newsinslowfrench.com/">News in Slow French</a> – I am trying to learn French at the moment and listening to this podcast about once a week helps me hear French a lot better. I must confess a lot of the time I have no idea what is being said, but I am slowly getting better at understanding it. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/overture8">Phil McClure</a> for suggesting this.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me">My Brother, My Brother and Me</a> – A comedy podcast by three brothers. It revolves around giving out advice to people who write in and answering Yahoo Answers questions. Properly funny at times. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/adamlunn">Adam Lunn</a> for turning me onto these guys.</li>
<li><a href="http://qi.com/podcast/">No Such Thing as a Fish</a> – Entertaining factual podcast from the researches of the TV show QI. Each week they discuss their four favourite facts from the week. I always learn something when I listen and am always entertained. Cheers to <a href="https://twitter.com/ianrobinson">Ian Robinson</a> for this suggestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would love to know what podcasts you listen to, I am always on the lookout for more so please do let me know in the comments.</p>

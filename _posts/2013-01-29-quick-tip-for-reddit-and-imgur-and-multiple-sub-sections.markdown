<p>This might be common knowledge, but it is news to me so I wanted to share it.</p>
<p>If you are a frequent user of either Reddit or Imgur you will know that you can just type <code>/r/{subreddit}</code> to jump to your sub-section of choice (and if you didn't, you are going to learn two things today!).</p>
<p>What I didn't know until today is that you can chain these subreddits by adding a plus sign, so say I wanted to look at the top posts for both html and css, I could visit <a href="http://reddit.com/r/html+css/">http://reddit.com/r/html+css</a>.</p>
<p>That is pretty cool and means I can start to make a handful of bookmarks the group together related subreddits (and to a lesser extent related imgurs).</p>
<p>If you are a Reddit user and found this useful, feel free to make sure it gets noticed by contributing on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/meta/comments/17gqrd/quick_tip_for_reddit_and_imgur_and_multiple/">comments here</a>.</p>

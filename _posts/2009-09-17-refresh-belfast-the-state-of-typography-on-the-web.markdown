<p>I was emailed about this event a couple of days ago and I have decided to sign up for it.</p>
<p>Very basically Christopher Murphy and Nicklas Persson are going to spend an evening (an evening on the 21st September in the Black Box in Belfast) talking about and showing us a few of the new typography-centred services that are floating about these days.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://www.tosbourn.com/2009/09/typography/">mentioned in a previous post</a> that I just don't get typography, so hopefully it won't be too over my head but even more hopefully I hope to learn a lot from it.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know about <a href="http://refreshbelfast.org/">Refresh Belfast</a> I have cleverly hidden a link to their site somewhere in this post.  In case you can't find it here is some blurb from <a href="http://refreshbelfast.org/">their site</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Refresh is a monthly event for designers, developers, coders, geeks &amp; nerds to get together to talk design, debate the web, share ideas and meet new &amp; interesting people. Every third Monday of the month, we organise a couple of presentations from local industry experts to be enjoyed over a few beers in the The Black Box.</p></blockquote>
<p>If anyone is free on that Monday and wants to come along they need to <a href="http://refreshbelfast.eventbrite.com/">sign up in advance</a>, it is completely free and the registration was insanely quick.  If you are coming along be sure to say hey!  I will be the one with the beard looking confused and angry!</p>

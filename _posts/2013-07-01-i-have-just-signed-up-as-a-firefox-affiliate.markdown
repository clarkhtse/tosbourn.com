    Thanks for the reply.

    But, what are those banners, buttons, etc asking for clicks, offering T-shirts, can you elaborate. Is this any kind of use for me? If so how?
                           Thank you..

  content: https://affiliates.mozilla.org/en-US/ has more information – Basically
    you promote Firefox, there is a leaderboard for traffic sent and the leaders get
    the chance to win Mozilla prizes.

<p>Today I signed up as a Firefox Affiliate.</p>
<p>What this means is that occasionally I will share Firefox/Mozilla related news on my blog and social media pages.</p>
<p><a href="//affiliates.mozilla.org/link/banner/39948"><img src="//affiliates.mozilla.org/media/uploads/banners/fd4b8f93cb98d8776bdda2220065fef3c62b74a3.png" alt="Download: Fast, Fun, Awesome" /></a></p>
<p>Obviously there is no financial gain to be had by doing this but I think Mozilla's mission is a worthy one and I think the Firefox browser is top notch.</p>
<p>The big push at the moment is of course on <a href="http://affiliates.mozilla.org/link/banner/39949">Firefox OS</a> something that I have written about before and am very excited about, expect a more thorough post on my thoughts about the latest Firefox OS news soon.</p>
<p>Long Live Firefox!</p>

    the first movie was wonderful. Especially the girl was a perfect player. 
    Second movie was also perfect, Lisbeth was not as psycho as she was in the previous version... But still was good...

    Waiting for the second ones new version.

<p><strong>Absolutely nothing.</strong></p>
<p>So please just enjoy stuff without having to link it to web design, or web development, or pretty much anything that is within my field of interest - I am sick of reading posts that include tenuous links to either the current trend or to something quirky that can act as link bait.</p>
<p>If the points you raise are valid and haven't been covered 100 times before then please just make a standard post and let your content be the thing that makes it stand out, not the gimmick you have attached to it.</p>

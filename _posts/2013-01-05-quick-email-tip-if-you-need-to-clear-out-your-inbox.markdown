<p>A couple of days ago I wrote about <a title="Finding email to delete if you are over quota in mail.app on OSx" href="http://tosbourn.com/2013/01/osx/finding-email-to-delete-if-you-are-over-quota-in-mail-app-on-osx/">clearing out your email using mail.app</a> and I have written about email before, like how <a title="Entering your email at the inbox is a bad idea" href="http://tosbourn.com/2012/08/productivity/entering-your-email-at-the-inbox-is-a-bad-idea/">entering your email at your inbox is a bad idea</a> and <a title="Howto: Email A Support Request" href="http://tosbourn.com/2010/11/web-stuff/howto-email-a-support-request/">how to email a support request</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I want to highlight something that the lovely Elaine Henry mentioned to me when she was reading that post from a couple of days ago, her first idea to remove email wasn't anything to do with looking at the size of the email (which was a tip I had mentioned), it was to do with the importance of the email.</p>
<p>She suggested <strong>searching for "Unsubscribe"</strong> as a way to remove perhaps unnecessary emails.</p>
<p>Her reasoning being that oftentimes emails that allow you to unsubscribe are generic emails with little permanent value. This makes a lot of sense and is something I will be running on my various email addresses.</p>

<p>Recently I ran into an issue with key based authentication between Netbeans and an sFTP server.Â  It was returning an error saying I had an invalid private key.</p>
<p>The key worked for other tools, so I was slightly confused why it wouldn't for Netbeans.</p>
<p>After some digging I uncovered that Netbeans doesn't like PPK files, it needs OpenSSH key files in order to connect with key based authentication</p>
<p>The fix is pretty simple;</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">PuTTY Key Generator</a>.</li>
<li>Open your PPK file. (<strong>File &gt; Load Private Key</strong>)</li>
<li>Convert your file. (<strong>Conversions &gt; Export OpenSSH Key</strong>)</li>
<li>Load this as your key file in Netbeans.</li>
</ol>

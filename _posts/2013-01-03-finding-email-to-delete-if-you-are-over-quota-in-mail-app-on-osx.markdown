<p>At work I use mail.app on my machine which pulls email from an Exchange server. For some reason we have relatively small mail limits and I don't think they are going to be increased anytime soon, so occasionally old email needs to be purged. This should be a best practice anyway because I am sure 60%+ of your email has no need to be stored after one month.</p>
<p>An issue with mail.app is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to view an entire mailbox (all folders listed in one view), if I was able to view this I could easily sort by size and delete the worst offenders.</p>
<p>The workaround is to target the folder that is the largest and then find the largest emails within it.</p>
<p>To do this right click on the mailbox that is full and click get account info.</p>
<p>The first time you run this it might take a minute or two to calculate all the folders but once it has you can sort by size and use that as the basis for your email hunt.</p>
<p>A more permanent solution would be to think about the email you are saving when you process your email and only keep mail that you think you will need - especially if people are sending files.</p>

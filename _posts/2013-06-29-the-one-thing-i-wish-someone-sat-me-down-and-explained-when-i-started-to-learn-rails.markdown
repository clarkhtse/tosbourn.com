<p>On Thursday and Friday of this week the company I work for put all the developers, designers and testers on a two day training session that covered the basics of Git, Ruby, Rails, Backbone and Test Driven Development.</p>
<p>It was really informative, I learned a lot of new things that I had maybe assumed wrongly in the past and picked up a lot of nice tricks, if you follow me on Twitter you probably seen me tweeting them out (Pro-Tip: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/tosbourn">Follow me on Twitter</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway, there was something the trainer mentioned in passing, which is something I know now but isn't something I have always known and I think that if I had known it early on it would have removed a lot of the magic and unknown about Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p><strong>Rails is just a set of gems.</strong></p>
<p>Easy, isn't it? And if you have been doing any Rails development for any length of time this will become obvious but it isn't obvious at the start, or at least for me it wasn't.</p>
<p>The main purpose of Rails is that it packages up a lot of really useful other gems, to essentially give the developer a great set of tools to help them on their way.</p>
<p>Now all you need to realise is that a gem is essentially just a class containing some functionality and suddenly things start to make a lot more sense.</p>

<p>Well it is probably charitable to call it an Easter Egg, but I wanted to have a look at the code that is created in Chrome in the "New Tab" view.</p>
<p>I didn't get very far before I found this rather excellent comment, which I wanted to share.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chromelordoftherings.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909" title="chromelordoftherings" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chromelordoftherings.png" alt="" width="544" height="523" /></a></p>
<p>To replicate;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Google Chrome</li>
<li>Create a new tab</li>
<li>Open Dev Tools (you can also view the source, but there is a shed load of stuff in the <code></code> to work through.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from this nerdy reference there is also a lot of code (1.2 MB worth, to be precise) that I want to spend some time looking through, expect some more posts in the future about it.</p>

<p>Windows 7 doesn't have Telnet enabled by default, which I guess is fair enough since most people will never have to use it.Â  If like me you need to then you just need to click the following...</p>
<ol>
<li>Start</li>
<li>Control Panel</li>
<li>Programs And Features</li>
<li>Turn Windows features on or off</li>
<li>Tick Telnet Client</li>
<li>Press OK</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully this helps save someone 5 minutes some day!</p>

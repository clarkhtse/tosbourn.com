As well as writing way more this year (see my [365 post
article](/365-articles-2015/)) one of the other things I wanted to do was to get some content on YouTube. I wanted to start with getting two videos up and if I enjoyed the process and people found them useful then I would consider maybe doing more.

Well yesterday I shared my first ever technical YouTube video

This was to compliment a post I wrote back in 2011 on [showing changed files in an old commit with git](/git-command-to-show-files-changed-in-a-commit/).

## Baby Steps

If you watch the video you will see it is under a minute and talking about one very small bit of functionality. I didn’t want to bite off more than I could chew for a first effort. That being said I did learn a lot which I am going to fold into the next video.

## The setup for that video

For this video I just used the QuickTime screen capture feature and the inbuilt mic on my MacBook Pro.

I saved the video in that standard format and uploaded it straight to YouTube.

## Use a proper mic

I am going to borrow a mic from somewhere to use for the next one. I have heard this as a top tip for podcasters and I can see why – If I can eliminate that tapping sound when I type it would be a big win.

## Have more dry runs

I recorded that video after one proper dry run, it was a huge improvement from the first when ever other word was “ummm” but there are still a few ummms and poorly enunciated words in there which I would like to kill next time.

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2212" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pentest.png" alt="pentest" width="175" height="213" />Today I am going to be reviewing the kindle edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KLAJ6TA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00KLAJ6TA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=tosbourn-21">Penetration Testing with the Bash Shell</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst I am aware of what penetration testing is I can't say that it is something I have any real expertise in, so I started this book hoping to learn a lot. Unfortunately it didn't really deliver at all.</p>
<p>The first half of the book is all about finding your way around the bash prompt, at first I was happy to see this since for many readers this could be their first time using a Linux environment.</p>
<p>As the examples became more obscure however and we started learning how to change the colour of our command prompt - I really started to feel like the author had a word count to fill.</p>
<p>Once we got into what seemed like useful content I ran into another issue - Kali, the environment suggested by the author refused to run correctly for me. I have actually written about how I was able to get <a title="Kali Linux 32 bit mini ISO getting stuck on samba" href="http://tosbourn.com/kali-linux-32-bit-mini-iso-getting-stuck-samba/">Kali to finally install for me</a>, but unfortunately I was not able to get Kali to startup once it was installed.</p>
<p>Naturally I can't blame the book for this, but it does mean that I wasn't able to try many of the examples.</p>
<p>The book goes on to talk in detail about topics like;</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Metasploit</li>
<li>MAC and ARP abuse</li>
<li>Brute-forcing Authentication</li>
<li>Assessing SSL Implementation Security</li>
</ul>
<p>All great stuff and I hope sometime to be able to run through the examples completely.</p>
<p>Honestly, at the price I wouldn't recommend this book, the writing wasn't great, it was very slow to start and I think there is just enough great information available for free online.</p>

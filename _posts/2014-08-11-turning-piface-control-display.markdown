<p>I have been playing with the <a href="http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/controlanddesign">PiFace Control and Display</a>Â and have been absolutely loving it. I will be posting up plenty more about it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-11-16.33.57.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2286" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-11-16.33.57-768x1024.jpg" alt="2014-08-11 16.33.57" width="474" height="632" /></a>I have noticed when I am using the Python library <a href="http://piface.github.io/pifacecad/reference.html">PiFaceCAD</a> and do something daft that makes the program exit incorrectly the LCD screen doesn't clean up after itself.</p>
<p>It feels like this would be a drain on battery and just knacker the hardware a bit quicker so I have written a quick <a href="https://github.com/tosbourn/turn-off-piface-control-and-display">Python script that will turn the LCD screen off</a>. You can run this if ever you notice your screen on when it shouldn't be.</p>

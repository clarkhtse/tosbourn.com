<p>Earlier today I was reading a great post <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/531911/isaac-asimov-asks-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/">onÂ creativity</a>, it was thought provoking, insanely relevant and<strong> it was written 55 years ago </strong>by Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>You will be surprised to know that Asimov didn't write this thinking it would make a great blog post some day, sit on the first page of some major link sharing websites and get hundreds or thousands of shares across various social networks.</p>
<p>He didn't even write it to a mass audience, he wrote it for a small team of scientists.</p>
<p>This is clearly an extreme example, there are few that could get their point across just like Asimov but the point I would like to make is that if you invest in good content it can reap rewards for years to come.</p>
<p>Can you say the same about your marketing or SEO campaign? You cannot. I have made the <a title="Problems with Evergreen Content" href="http://tosbourn.com/problems-with-evergreen-content/">case against evergreen content</a> before, but there are clearly some benefits.</p>

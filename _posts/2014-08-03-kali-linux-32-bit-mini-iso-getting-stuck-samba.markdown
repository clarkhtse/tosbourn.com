<p>I have been trying to install the Kali Linux 64 bit mini ISO from the official <a href="http://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali downloads</a> page recently. The way I was doing it was downloading the mini ISO and booting it up with Virtual Box on my OSx machine.</p>
<p>I tried three different times to install it, each time it would just freeze up whilst it was setting up Samba.</p>
<p>The fix I went for, which admittedly is a bit of a cop out but *did* work was to instead download the full ISO,Kali Linux 64 bit ISO. I am not sure if it was the fact it is a point release higher (1.0.8 instead of 1.0.7), or the fact there is clearly more stuff in the full image.</p>

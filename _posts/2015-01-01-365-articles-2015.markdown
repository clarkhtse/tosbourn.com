Something I really let go to pot in 2014 was the amount that I wrote online. I enjoy writing and want to try and force myself to do more of it. This is why in 2015 I am going to attempt to commit to writing 365 articles. Before you deem me insane, here are the rules.

## My Arbitrary Rules for this Arbitrary Goal

 * It isn't an article a day, I could have days without any and suddenly five appear at once.
 * They don't have to be all on my blog, in fact I will be contacting people to try and get guest posts and will be writing more on other sites I already contribute to.
 * They don't have to appear on a blog at all, so long as they are publicly accessible it will count (for example I might do longer Ello posts, or something like that).
 * Each article should be at least 300 words, this is to stop me writing really quick updates and hopefully means the articles have substance.  (This means that if all goes well I will have written over 109500 words by the end of this, pretty cool!)
 * The content can be pretty much anything, it will likely stay within the confines of what I normally write about but we shall see!
 * I can ignore any of the above rules should I decide to.

## Keeping up to date with my progress

At the bottom of this post I will keep a running tally of all the articles, this will likely be updated once a week or so, if you don't see it being updated as often as you think please do give me a poke and let me know! I will likely be tweeting about new articles and things I put out, if you don't follow me now might be a good time! <a href="https://twitter.com/tosbourn">@tosbourn</a>

## Do you think I can do it?

Do you think this is something I can stick to? Let me know on Twitter or better yet leave a comment!

## Do you run a site?

If you run a site and would be interested in having me write something for you please <a href="mailto:toby.osbourn@gmail.com">drop me an email</a>. As well as getting free content without an agenda I will be linking to it here and other places.

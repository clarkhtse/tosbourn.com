<p>About a month or two ago I was given a Mac in work to use to replace my shitty old Windows laptop.</p>
<p>I have to admit I was very dubious at the start because I have a deep hatred for the Mac fanboy culture (and I still do) however I was quickly won round by the Mac's responsive hardware and slick OS.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to realise why some people where very fanboyish about the whole thing (there is still no excuse for it though!) and I starting considering changing my home setup to a Mac.</p>
<p>The main reason why I didn't was because my Windows machine is relatively new and fairly bitching, it cost a lot and I would like to get a lot of use out of it.</p>
<p>That and the fact that Windows is a fine operating system for what I use it for, sure there are annoyances but there is nothing I personally need to do that Windows Vista couldn't do for me.</p>
<p>My stance changed about 4 hours ago however whenever after installing the latest service pack  the night before (how ruddy cavalier of me!) my computer refused to start. Long story short the service pack seemed to have half installed and borked the OS completely, I ran different repairs on it but to no avail.</p>
<p>Now I am in the process of downloading a live Linux CD in order to run and then backup a couple of files/folders that I would like but are deemed not important enough to have running on my normal backups. Once this is done I will be installing Windows 7 onto the machine and starting from scratch.</p>
<p>I have played about with Windows 7 and like it, but the very first time it gives me any amount of crap I think the back will be broken and an order will be being placed with Apple.</p>
<p>Bloody Windows…</p>

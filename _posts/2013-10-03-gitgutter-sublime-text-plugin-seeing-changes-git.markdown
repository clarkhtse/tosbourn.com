<p><a href="https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter">GitGutter</a> is one of my favourite Sublime Text plugins, and it is one of the first to be installed when I am setting up a new environment.</p>
<h2>What is GitGutter?</h2>
<p>GitGutter allows you to see what changes have happened since your last commit in git, it will let you easily see what lines have been added, removed or edited.</p>
<h2>Why use GitGutter?</h2>
<p>If you are a git user, having a view on what has changed as part of your next commit is incredibly useful – You can see at a glance in a file if you have removed something, which is handy if you make a change and walk away from your machine and need to get a feel for what you were doing.</p>
<h2>Features of GitGutter</h2>
<p>As well as visually showing you what lines have changed, you can also do the following with GitGutter;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump between changes (super useful in a large file)</li>
<li>Set it to only update once the file saves, or have it update live (I prefer live)</li>
<li>Change the colour of how GitGutter is presented (I have no problems with the default)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing GitGutter</h2>
<p>My preferred way to install it is using the very popular Sublime Package Control, but you can also clone the code needed from the <a href="https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter">Github repository</a>.</p>

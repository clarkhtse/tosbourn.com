    Second the comment about version control.
    They need to do a module on Linux.  Far too many people only really get to grips with Linux at home or struggle through it in their job.  It really should be taught.  As computer scientists, we should be laughed at if we cant use or fear the command line!  Install / configure / secure apache and php and mysql should be part of the test.

    I would hesitate to teach an operating system in a software development or computer science course. Sure, teach it in Sysadmin/Tech Support/Network Maintenance courses, but an actual OS itself is a) too hard to choose one without alienating other relevant OSes, and b) too hard to choose one which won't date poorly. The use of operating systems is something for both generic vocational courses and the likes of introductory computing courses at evening classes, if necessary.

    Installation, configuration of the LAMP stack shouldn't be taught in Comp Sci or Software Development either. Again, more of a candidate for a Computing &amp; IT or Syadmin type course than either Theoretical Computing or actual Software Engineering. The relevance is arguable when you choose to pick one of these instead of others - why not Python instead of PHP? Why not Postgres instead of MySQL?

    Command line interfaces are something that should be taught during a Computing &amp; IT course, likewise server maintenance and application configuration but as far as Computer Science and Software Development degrees go I disagree that it would be something worth focusing on. The problem with throwing in things that are "nice to have" is the exclusion of things that should be mandatory - we wouldn't want Software Development graduates leaving university knowing all about how to configure Apache and not knowing what a design pattern is - that way madness lies. The most useful university education is in teaching theories and their correct application - we want our graduates to be intelligent generalists, rather than already specialists before choosing an area of employment in industry. It reduces flexibility and narrows one's opportunities at too early a stage.

    I agree that graduates should be intelligent generalists but at the moment there is a massive disconnect between what people leave university with and what employers want.

    I can only speak with experience from web development but I know they want specific knowledge in a very narrow subset of skills.

    Perhaps an ideal would be a T shape to the learning, you become proficient at the entire skill set that everyone will be learning, then you specialise in maybe 1 or 2 modules that would make you an employable programmer in x, y or z industries.

<p>This morning Will Hamill asked my opinions on what I would change or add onto the Computer Science course with a view to making it more Software Developmenty (Developmenty is, in fact, a word).</p>
<p>Here are my initial thoughts, some of them are things I have thought would be good for a while, others came into my head this morning when mulling it over.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least a theoretical knowledge of version control systems. (Probably a half module)</li>
<li>Practical knowledge of code reviews, bug finding and issue reporting. (Full module)</li>
<li>Practical Code Security (See: <a title="OWASP Education Project" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project">OWASP Education Project</a>) (1 Basic module, 1 Advanced module)</li>
<li>A greater emphasis placed on maintainable code. (Throughout other modules)</li>
<li>A greater emphasis on the need to adhere to current best practices. (Throughout other modules)</li>
<li>A Testing module, with practical examples of all the different phases of testing. (Full module)</li>
</ul>
<p>What would you change about the university course you took?</p>

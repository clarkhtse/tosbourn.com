  content: Was this written five years ago????  I cannot find where "Veiw All My Transactions"
    is anymore, since they changed the damn website!!  I cannot find, anywhere, how
    the hell to find a particular transaction!!!  Some other lady, on another site,
    said to go under "Account Overview."  I can't find where the hell that is either!  This
    really should not be difficult, at all!!!  It's ridiculous!!!!!!!

    It was written two years ago and is sadly out of date.

    Unfortunately I have a business account now with a different layout or I would detail how to do this.

<p>This is something I have only just learned how to do, and I am sure a lot of people didn't know it was possible because it isn't the most advertised feature and the PayPal interface isn't the most intuitive thing I have ever used.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into PayPal</li>
<li>Click View All My Transactions</li>
<li>Click Find a Transaction</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy! You can select by email, or name, or some others. Make sure you pick an appropriate date range and you will be flying!</p>

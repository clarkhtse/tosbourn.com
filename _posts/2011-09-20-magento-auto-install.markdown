    It's really good idea to use bash scripting instead of typing the series of command via SSH.
    Also if you could modify the script in order to provide the option for installing the sample db or not, that would be great.

    Thanks

    Hey MagePsycho,

    Funny that was something that I had already decided will be going into my roadmap for development. Glad someone else agrees.

    Hey Adam,

    No, this is nothing to do with my script, I have never heard about it before but I will look into it - thanks!

<p>This morning I wrote a script to help automate installing Magento websites, I figured I would chuck it up onto github for feedback and on the off chance it would help someone.</p>
<p><a title="Magento Auto Install" href="https://github.com/tosbourn/Magento-Auto-Install" target="_blank">https://github.com/tosbourn/Magento-Auto-Install</a></p>
<p>If you are a Magento dev I would love some feedback - When I get chance I will write up what I will be adding to it in the future.Â  I will also write up a proper guide to replace the README file.</p>

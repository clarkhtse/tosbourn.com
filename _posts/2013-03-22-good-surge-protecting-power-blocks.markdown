<p>I am writing this post from a very snowy and windy Belfast, so snowy and windy in fact that the power keeps on dipping in and out.</p>
<p>This worries me for two reasons, the first is that when the power dips out, I am without power and most of the stuff I like is also without power (and it needs power to function).</p>
<p>The second reason what that when the power dips in I am worried that the stuff I like is going to get too much of the power that it likes and it is going to knacker some part of the stuff I like.</p>
<p>The solution to the first problem is probably to have some form of backup generator or some sort of off the grid renewable energy source (which I have spent a little bit of time looking at tonight, but have found nothing concrete, that is another post for another night).</p>
<p>The solution to the second problem is what I want to blog about and that is about surge protection.</p>
<p>In really basic terms a surge is when too much electricity comes into your household because all your appliances want some at once, as a result too much can go into one appliance and it can break said appliance.</p>
<p>How you protect against surges is to have something in your setup that sits between your appliance and your power and says "<em>here, that is way too much power — wise up</em>" and stops the extra power getting to your appliance.</p>
<p>Recently I bought a new power block that did just this and I wanted to blog about it; here is the Amazon ad for it (disclaimer: complete with affiliate code)</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="http://rcm-uk.amazon.co.uk/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;nou=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=tosbourn-21&amp;o=2&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B006HFME4C" height="240" width="320" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>So what this is is a four point power block with two USB slots that has surge protection built in. It is nice and compact and doesn't look like arse.</p>
<p>I have found four points to be more than enough, especially as I can charge my phone and kindle using the USB slots and although I don't understand what technically sets this block out from any others in terms of surge protection, I do know it comes with a £10,000 guarantee if a device plugged into the surge protector dies of a surge. I have also found that anything I have needed to plug into it has slotted in perfectly, even though it is compact space hasn't been an issue.</p>
<p><strong>[breaking]</strong> I just wanted to interrupt this blog post to mention my power has just went off and on again there and my laptop didn't explode! Thank you surge protector!</p>
<p>On the downside it comes equipped with two lights, one to tell you it is on and the other to tell you that you are protected, this is nice but they are way too bright, to the point where I have stuck a sticking plaster over them to dim them down as one of mine lives beside my bed.</p>
<p>I don't want to labour this post too much &amp;mash; surge protection is a good idea, personally I would recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006HFME4C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B006HFME4C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=tosbourn-21">MasterPlug</a> but honestly it is up to you, the main thing is you get protected.</p>
<p>I would recommend you share this article with any friends or family that you think might benefit from having their stuff protected from surges.</p>

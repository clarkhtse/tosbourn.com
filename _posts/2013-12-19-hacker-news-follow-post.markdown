<p>This is my obligatory post about what happened as part of the aftermath of being on the Hacker News homepage for the best part of 12 hours recently.</p>
<p>I had written a post on a bit of a whim about some of the <a title="Working whenever you want is amazing and has some unique challenges" href="http://tosbourn.com/2013/12/productivity/the-problems-i-am-facing-with-being-able-to-work-whenever-i-want/">unique challenges associated with being able to set your own working hours</a>.</p>
<p>I say it was on a whim because initially it was going to be an email that I was going to circulate around the Buffer team, but I decided as well as their feedback I would love other folk to get involved and talk about their experiences.</p>
<p>So I wrote the post, put it live and shared the link on places like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1syg4d/the_problems_i_am_facing_with_being_able_to_work/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910891">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>As I have already said the whole purpose of the post was to try and get feedback, I had even done things like initially used the word ‘problem’ in the title because I know how much fellow engineers love solving them! With that in mind I wanted to first talk about the quantity and quality of the feedback.</p>
<p>As of writing these are the feedback stats;</p>
<ul>
<li>15 comments from others on the original post.</li>
<li>43 total comments on the Hacker News thread (some of these were mine in response to the kind folk who took time to comment).</li>
<li>10 total comments on the Reddit thread (again some of these are mine).</li>
<li>3 emails from folk wanting to thank or discuss the post via email.</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn’t be happier with the quantity and more importantly the quality of the responses, people really blew me away by taking time out of their day to share their experiences with a complete stranger, it was amazing.</p>
<h2>Traffic</h2>
<p>I know for a fact this is what a lot of the people reading this will be interested in, I know because normally when I read posts like these this is one of the things I like to see!</p>
<p>Just reporting on traffic is a pure vanity metric but it was so lovely to see a massive spike in traffic in terms of overall traffic but also concurrent folk using the site at once.</p>
<p>Graphs always speak better than words for this, so here are some screenshots :-)</p>

Did not think people would click into it but they clearly did!</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>I wanted to take an opportunity to publicly call out the great work done by my hosting company <a href="http://www.bigwetfish.co.uk/whmcs/aff.php?aff=264">Big Wet Fish</a>.</p>
<p>The site survived this massive traffic spike without once slowing down or becoming unavailable.  I didn’t give them any prior warning and it isn’t like I am paying out of the nose for something far heavier than I need, they do good work and are constantly keeping their server offerings fresh :-)</p>
<h2>Twitter Followers</h2>
<p>Something that I had recently added to my blog was a call to action to follow me on Twitter (by the way, you should <a title="Working whenever you want is amazing and has some unique challenges" href="http://twitter.com/tosbourn">follow me on Twitter</a>) so a nice side effect of the exposure was that I got around 25 new folk following me on Twitter.</p>
<h2>Other weird side effects</h2>
<p>Off the back of being seen on Hacker News I have now had two job offers and an advertising agency wanting to give me a better deal than the ads I currently serve. These were lovely emails to get although I did say no to all three!</p>
<p>By the way, if you have something to say about the <a title="Working whenever you want is amazing and has some unique challenges" href="http://tosbourn.com/2013/12/productivity/the-problems-i-am-facing-with-being-able-to-work-whenever-i-want/">original post</a>, I would love to hear your thoughts!</p>

<p>Now I am not going to be one of these people who only posts up apologies for never posting, but you may have noticed that a lot of my posts recently have just been linking to other peoples work and saying how much I agree with it.  The reason I have been doing this is simply because there is a lot of quality articles out there, and whilst I do have every plan to create some of my own very soon I want to keep the site ticking over whilst I get my creative arse in gear!</p>
<p>So today I want to chat about the SM post entitled '<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/20/50-new-css-techniques-for-your-next-web-design/">50 New CSS Techniques For Your Next Web Design</a>' it is a quality article (what else would you expect from Smashing Magazine) that basically runs down a list of blog posts and tutorials on how to achieve the very latest CSS things.  As with a lot of their articles you could always argue that this is all information that is freely available and perhaps that most web designers should already be taking for granted but the fact of the matter is that with so much new stuff constantly coming out, and so many people finding new ways of doing things these run downs are incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Things that I found especially interesting / useful were;</p>
<ul>
<li>Compressing JavaScript and CSS.</li>
<li>Useful layout tips and tricks.</li>
<li>Multiple Backgrounds.</li>
<li>A whole lot more.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would really suggest you bookmark this article and really spend time going through each of the sections.</p>

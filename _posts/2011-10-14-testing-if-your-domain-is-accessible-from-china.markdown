<p>Here is a very quick post for those of you interested in if China can see your website.</p>
<p>Whilst China isn't the only county guilty of censorship on the internet, it is probably the one with the most people sitting behind the Great Firewall of China - so if your site isn't getting past their censorship you could be missing out on a lot of traffic.</p>

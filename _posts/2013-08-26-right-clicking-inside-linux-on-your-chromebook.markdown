  content: Toby, these Chromebooks can be a bit odd sometimes, next time you're having
    an issue with a function, check how it's supposed to be done in the ChromeOS that's
    intended to run on your Chromebook. The ChromeOS manual clearly states the "two
    finger" tap - equals - "right click" (as well as the ALT + CLICK). I don't really
    like either of these for several reasons and would rather have an actual right
    click, but they DO tell you how right click is intended on these machines and
    checking will often save you lots of time by first trying the same thing in the
    Linux you're running to see if it works. Cheers, B

<p>If you are running a Linux distro from inside your Chromebook you might have some issues accessing the right click.</p>
<p>I am guessing this is because the Chromebook doesn't have a right click button per-say, just a contextual click by holding down alt when you click.</p>
<p>After much playing about with key combinations I found that using<strong> two fingers</strong> when you click on the button area will perform the same action as right click.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help someone else who is hopelessly trying to get a right click menu up!</p>

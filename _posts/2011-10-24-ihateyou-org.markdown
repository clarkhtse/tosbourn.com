<p>I like to consider myself a bit of an oldfag on the internet (if you get the reference, I bet you can tri-force too) and as such it really pisses me off the amount of people taking internet things and making them into real life things.  I think it first started with leet speak becoming allowed in everyday conversations - If I hear one more person say el-oh-el I am going to explode, but that isn't my rant today.</p>
<p>Recently people have started saying things like "I am so jealous.com" or "cool.com".</p>
<p>Well, do you know what, if you are one of those people.</p>
<p>FUCKYOU.NET</p>
<p>Sorry.org, that was a bit harsh-of.me, but people need to stop being so damned retarded.biz</p>
<p>It isn't cute, or nerdy, or funny - it is stupid.  Please stop it.</p>

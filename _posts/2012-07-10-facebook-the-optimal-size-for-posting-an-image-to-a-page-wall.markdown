<p>Facebook is pretty good at being smart about posting images to a page wall, it tries to scale them properly but in order to make sure your image gets posted properly you should probably stick to <strong>400 x 400</strong> pixels.</p>
<p>If you put the effort in up front to optimise your image for a Facebook wall you can maintain all the control and can be sure it will look decent when people find it.</p>
<p>If you don't like the idea of square images I would suggest that the height is probably more flexible than the width.</p>

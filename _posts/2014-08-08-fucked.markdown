<p>I fucked up.</p>
<p>Recently I wrote a book about how to make money online and self published it, I did it for all the wrong reasons and I rushed it because of those wrong reasons.</p>
<p>As a result I have put something out there that is of poor quality and a terrible reflection of what I am capable of.</p>
<p>I have let down anyone who bought it, anyone that shared the news it was out and basically anyone involved.</p>
<p>If you have bought the book in the next 24 hours you will be getting a refund from PayPal, I am very sorry.</p>
<p>I will also be pulling the book from this site and from Amazon.</p>
<p>I won't be makingÂ the same mistake again, I promise.</p>

<p>So today I did one really sucky thing and one really awesome thing;</p>
<p>The really sucky thing was handing in my notice at my current role at <a title="Team Solutionz" href="http://teamsolutionz.com">Team Solutionz</a>, I really enjoyed my time there and thoroughly loved working along side a bunch of talented and fun people.</p>
<p>I have never had to hand in notice in a real job before (I am not including part time shop work etc) and it wasn't pleasant, but the company were understanding and supportive, which was excellent.</p>
<p>The really awesome thing was accepting a job offer at <a title="Pierce Communications" href="http://www.piercecommunications.co.uk/">Pierce Communications</a>, I will be joining their Internet Marketing team as a developer working for some pretty cool clients in order to give them a kick-ass web presence.  I am excited to take up this new challenge and I am really looking forward to learning new skills and working with some excellent people.</p>
<p>These recent developments have re-ignited my love for the web so hopefully I will get back into the way of posting here more often!</p>

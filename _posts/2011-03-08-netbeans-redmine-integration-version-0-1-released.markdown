    Good job :)
    (I'm not a user of your tool. However I like Redmine and would like it to be as featureful as possible!)

    a small 'R' - if you click it you should be able to add basic issues, there is
    still a lot of development to do on it!!

    Hey,

    It isn't being a muppet, the plugin is in it's very early stages so there are no bells and whistles yet!  You need to go into your preferences where you will find a redmine tab, add your api details there.

    Where is it you get your API key?

    Wish I could contribute but my only knowledge of Java is jQuery :)

    I will feature it in my Tutorial of building a development Environment when I have finished my site though...

    Hi there,

    Thanks for getting in touch - I have plans to rewrite this properly, but they are very low on my list of priorities I am afraid.

    Go to My Account and on the right side of the screen, you'll see RSA and API keys.  Just click on the Show link and it'll show you your key.

    ...passing on what a mentor passed on to me.

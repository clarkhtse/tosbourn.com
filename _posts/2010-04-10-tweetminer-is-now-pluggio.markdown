<p>I haven't been using <a href="http://pluggio.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=111">Tweetminer</a> as much as I probably should recently (especially since I bought a paid subscription to it!) but I do like to keep on top of any developments going on with it.</p>
<p>Once such development is that now it will be tying in to other social networks (Facebook, MySpace etc) and as a result the name Tweetminer doesn't really fit.</p>
<p>I think Pluggio is a little 2.0 sounding (and therefore, ridiculous) but that didn't stop me getting addicted to all those other services with cute names or vowels missing.</p>

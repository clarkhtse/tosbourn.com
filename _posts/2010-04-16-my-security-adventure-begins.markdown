<p>I am starting to get into this security game and I figured I would blog about different things I have done to help tighten up security in all aspects of web app deployment.</p>
<p>As the title of this post suggests, I am only beginning my journey and am pretty much assuming no prior knowledge and I am taking nothing for granted, with that in mind I figured the first thing I should be doing is getting me an education in web app security.  Obviously this is a huge sphere with many caveats and it would be impossible for me to become a security ninja in all aspects but I hope to be able to know my way around most of the major security concerns we face as an industry.</p>
<p>Like any self-respecting nerd the first thing I did was google 'website security' from then on I started refining my search, following links, reading articles and setting myself up with a bit of a knowledge base, I thought I would share with you some really useful sites and stuff I have found.</p>

</a><a href="http://ha.ckers.org/">Ha.ckers</a><br />
<a href="http://www.mckeay.net/">McKeay</a></p>
<p>The most useful site I have found though has to be <a href="http://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a> it is absolutely jam packed with really excellent information about Web Application Security, I was able to join the mailing list for the Irish chapter (something I have yet to really start looking into but plan to get involved really soon).  They also have an excellent Podcast, well worth checking out.</p>

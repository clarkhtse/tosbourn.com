<p>Today I found a presentation that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/psynnott" target="_blank">Paul Synnott</a> made that was aimed at explaining the need for Git, or at least version control to non-developers.</p>
<p>I thought it was an excellent way of explaining to someone who doesn't like technical jargon, or is too inexperienced to understand it why time should be invested in using Version Control.</p>
<p>I asked if I could chuck it up here for others to download and he agreed, so here it is:</p>

<p>If you are part of a company that is allowed to vote you should, these folk help shape the internet and <a href="http://briankardell.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/the-new-gang-of-four/">voting in the right people is important</a>.</p>
<p>Paul Irish has explained everything fairly well <a href="https://plus.google.com/113127438179392830442/posts/ix4bWGNRy33">here</a>, but basically if you work for a company that can vote (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List</a>) you should contact your AC representative to vote.</p>
<p>If you could pass this about that would be excellent, or if you would like to discuss on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5028480">Hacker News</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/167d63/hours_remain_to_help_and_try_elect_the_right/">Reddit</a>, that is cool too!</p>

  content: Very interesting. As a non-dyslexic it felt like the glyphs were moving
    as I read. Not a comfortable reading experience at all. The inconsistently 'blotchy'
    appearance of the glyphs is my main gripe. I would love to read more about the
    science behind it. As you say it's probably not a one size fits all solution.

  content: 'Agreed about the blotchy appearance. I haven''t read it yet but here is
    the research paper on fonts for dyslexia that was cited as showing that these
    fonts might not be the best, of course there are going to be other studies saying
    the opposite! : http://www.luzrello.com/Publications_files/assets2013.pdf'

  content: I found the text hard to read, a little sore on the eyes to be honest.
    It would be great if there was an option on sites to change fonts if you are dyslexic
    (provided this does actually make a difference).

  content: I have been diagnosed with dyslexia over 10 years now, I don't tend to
    find issues with fonds online only in cases where the colour of the font and background
    colour blend into each other. I have read through some of the pages from Dyslexie
    front and open dyslexic, I actually find their text harder to read, one main issue
    I find is when scrolling through the text trying to skim read or look for keywords
    the text becomes almost unreadable.

  content: As a dyslexic I found the font easier to read that normal fonts, I'm pretty
    sure I would have made more mistakes in reading it had it been in something else.
    Shame the font is not looker.

    I didn't notice it being sore on my eyes, but it was certainly harder to read.

    I think having a switcher of some sort might be a good idea!

  content: Interesting you bring up skim reading, I wonder if the use case they are
    trying to fix isn't what most people do online? (as most people do skim and look
    for keywords)

    I am dyslexic, once I stopped focusing on the unique aspects of the font, and concentrated on reading, it went very smoothly.  I was easily able to read large amounts of the text.  And I did like the oversized punctuation.

    But, coming in for the first time it was jarring.  The font is good, but I had to force my brain to think it was normal to read it effectively.

  content: I see the comments and a typeface can be seen two ways see text and read
    text. And believe me i designed the typeface Dyslexie to be read. I also can announce
    that we have set the Dyslexie font free for home users. So just try it on your
    computer and see also the manual to set your browser to display site in the Dyslexie
    font. www.dyslexiefont.com If you have any question about the Dyslexie font please
    let me know.

    Thanks Toby. Some questions i see in your article I heard before of people that don't have dyslexia. "If the Dyslexie font is a disadvantages non dyslexics." (next to that everybody has his own preference for typefaces) But there is a research done by the university of Amsterdam on this subject.  And this say's there is no disadvantage for non Dyslexics. You can find the total report with the other researches on this page of our site www.dyslexiefont.com/en/dyslexia-font/research/

    My own reaction on this is always:  I wish that I could tell you how it is to read with Dyslexie font as a person without dyslexia.

<p>Recently I read <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/quickpanel-dyslexia">an article</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/mpaciello">Mike Paciello</a> had shared that talked about some of the accessibility concerns around catering for folk who have dyslexia.</p>
<p>Naively I had always assumed that if you cater for folk with colour blindness and the visually impaired that you were making your website better for everyone, but this isn't so. People with dyslexia can normally read better with a slightly lower contrast and font choice can play a large role in how easy someone is able to comprehend what is written on screen.</p>
<p>The article mentioned two fonts in particular which had been designed from the ground up to be easier for dyslexic folk to read, although it should be noted the article also mentions that one study shown no improvement when using these fonts;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/dyslexia-font/">The Dyslexie Font</a>, this is a paid for font with different payment options depending on how you want to use it. They do offer a free plugin for your website that people can use to click a button to swap out the current font for the dyslexie font.</li>
<li><a href="http://opendyslexic.org">OpenDyslexic</a>, this is a free and open source font put out under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. They do ask that you provide a link to their site if you use it, which seems fair enough!</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally one of the really nice side effects of designing with accessibility in mind is that the end result is normally better for everyone, my feeling is that these fonts aren't going to be better for everyone. Personally I found the font a little jarring when reading lots of text, it felt like it was slowing me down (the same way comic-sans does), which of course is kind of the point of the font.</p>
<p>I would be very keen to hear from dyslexics to see if they find general reading on the web hard and to see if they find the linked fonts any easier to read (<a href="http://opendyslexic.org/try-it/">sample text</a>).</p>
<p>I would also love to hear from folk who aren't dyslexic to hear their opinions on reading the linked fonts (<a href="http://opendyslexic.org/try-it/">sample text</a>).</p>
<p>For more information on dyslexia you can check out the <a href="http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/">British Dyslexia Association's website </a>which has decided not to use different fonts.</p>

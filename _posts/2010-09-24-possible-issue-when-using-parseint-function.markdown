<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/psynnott" target="_blank">psynnott</a> recently pointed out that there was a potential issue in some of the code we had written.Â  It involved using the <strong>parseInt</strong> function of JavaScript in order to ensure we are dealing with integer values.</p>
<p>He noticed that if you pass a string of '09' the function will attempt to treat the value as an octal (which is a fairly insane thing to have as a default in my opinion) in order to fix this you would change</p>
<p><code>var test = parseInt('09');</code></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><code>var test = parseInt('09',10);</code></p>
<p>This will force base 10 to be used instead of octal.</p>

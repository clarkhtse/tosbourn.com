<p>I cannot believe I haven't written a post on the subject of <a title="Dropbox" href="http://db.tt/IlOuq8C" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> before now, better get to it!</p>
<p>I am sure you already know Dropbox and what it does but on the off chance you don't essentially it is file storage on the cloud.  That is it.  Pretty boring on the face of it but it enables you to do some pretty awesome things as a result.</p>
<p>Uses for Dropbox include;</p>
<ul>
<li>File Backup.</li>
<li>File Sharing between machines.</li>
<li>File Sharing between friends/others.</li>
<li>Syncing files between your main box and a mobile device.</li>
<li>Loads more, for example here is a <a title="LifeHacker Dropbox" href="http://lifehacker.com/5527055/the-cleverest-ways-to-use-dropbox-that-youre-not-using" target="_blank">LifeHacker post on different Dropbox uses</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dropbox is free (2GB going up to 8GB) with paid options if you want more space. Setup is easy and instant, usage is widespread and support is responsive. All in all it is very cool.</p>
<p>I use Dropbox to share some stuff with my friends, co-workers and girlfiend, to backup some important (but not private) information and to keep a handful of useful files close at hand at all times.  I have only ever really experienced issues when running a webserver in Dropbox with log files constantly changing, any other use case I have found for it has worked pretty much perfectly first time.</p>
<p>As well as having access to your files from your machines and mobile devices you can also access them using the web client, basically if you can get online you can get your files.</p>
<p>There have been some security concerns cited in the past mainly around ways <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/05/internet_security" target="_blank">keys could be spoofed</a>, and whilst this is a concern I feel the advantages of an account outweigh the negatives.  As I kind of alluded to earlier, I don't keep private information in Dropbox, whilst I hardly think my account will be the target of attackers I just like to remember this <a href="http://www.geardiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Privacy-Internet-Venn-Diagram.jpg" target="_blank">Venn diagram</a> from time to time!</p>
<p>All in all I think it is an excellent tool and would very much suggest using it.</p>

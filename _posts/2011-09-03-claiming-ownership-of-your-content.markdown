<p>If you write content for the web you should take steps to let Google know you are the owner of the content.</p>
<p>Among other things it helps to create a more semantic, connected web - this is a good thing.</p>
<p>Once you have that in place it is fairly easy to then get your profile information to display beside Google results, this includes your image, which I have read can improve click through rate.</p>
<p>The exact steps will vary depending on the CMS or content you are providing but here they are in basic terms;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an authors page (in wordpress this is done for you, it will list all the posts you create).</li>
<li>In any content you create link to the authors page usingÂ <em>rel="author"</em> inside the a tag.</li>
<li>From the authors page you need to link to your Google+ Account, in the a tag linking to it you need to include <em>rel="me"</em></li>
<li>On your Google+ profile page you need to link to the author page.</li>
<li>That is it - You can test your content to make sure it works by visiting the <a title="Rich Snippets Testing Tool" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">Rich Snippets Testing Tool</a>.</li>

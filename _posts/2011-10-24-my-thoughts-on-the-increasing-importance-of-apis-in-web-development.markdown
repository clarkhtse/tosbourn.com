<p>Recently I have read a NetTuts article titled <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/the-increasing-importance-of-apis-in-web-development/">The Increasing Importance of APIs in Web Development</a></p>
<p>I have played with a handful of APIs over the years but wouldn't call myself a particularly massive user of them but I do think they are the way forward for web development.  We really need to stop reinventing the wheel (unless we can bring something new or awesome to the table) and start creating cool shit.  And of course APIs can help you to do that.</p>
<p>The above article does an excellent job of explaining what APIs are, so I won't duplicate content here, but I will list some of the things I have taken away from the it;</p>
<ul>
<li>Google+ has an <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/api/" target="_blank">API</a> - I kind of assumed it would have but hadn't known for sure until today.  It only has read access for data made public, but that is still pretty cool and a solid start. (although if you follow <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts" target="_blank">Steve Yegge</a> you may think otherwise!)</li>
<li>I was reminded that Stack Exchange has an <a href="http://api.stackoverflow.com/1.0/usage" target="_blank">API</a> that I really need to play with sometime.</li>
<li>Via an advert on NetTuts I learned that <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/" target="_blank">SEOMoz</a> have a 30 day free trail of SEOMoz Pro, which is pretty interesting and something I might subscribe to and see how it goes.</li>
<li>I discovered the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/" target="_blank">ProgrammableWeb</a> website - an excellent resource for uncovering thousands of APIs - I have subscribed to <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/" target="_blank">their blog</a> as well, I figure it will be a good way to find out what sites are opening up their doors for us devs to play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play with more APIs.</p>

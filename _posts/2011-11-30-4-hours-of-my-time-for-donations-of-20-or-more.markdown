<p>If you sponsor my Movember efforts in the next two days by going to the following address -&gt; <a href="http://mobro.co/tosbourn">http://mobro.co/tosbourn</a> and if you give me £20 or more you will get 4 hours of development / consulting / tech support thrown in (as well as my gratitude).</p>
<p>All the money raised goes towards male cancers, which I am sure you will agree is a worthy cause.</p>
<p>Make sure your donation isn't anonymous and drop an email to <a href="mailto:toby.osbourn@googlemail.com">toby.osbourn@googlemail.com</a> when you have done it and want to claim the time!</p>
<p>If you are unsure of my skillset, browse the rest of this blog to get a feel for what I can and can't do and if you have any questions you have my email!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

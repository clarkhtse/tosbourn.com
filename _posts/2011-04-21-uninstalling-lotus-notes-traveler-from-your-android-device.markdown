    I  not able to uninstall traveler despite the disable through device administration. Neither force stop nor uninstall button get highlighted for me to do anything. On all other apps there options r highlighted to click but somehow on traveller it seems to have been hardcoded !
    Can someone suggest a way out

    I've followed all the instructions below.  Menu/Settings/Security//Device administrators
    When I try to un check the IBM Notes Traveler it comes up at the top. "Activate Device administrator?"  It does not give me the option to deactivate, only activate.....  But when I try to uninstall the app, it tells me that I have to uninstall the app before I can install....  AND when I go through the play store to deactivate, it tells me "this app is a device administrator and must be deactivated before uninstalling....AAAAAHHHHH  I'm soooo frustrated!!!  Has anyone ever had this issue?

    Sorry to report I have the exact same issue. When I uninstall I cannot due to the app being device admin, and when I deactivate the device admin I can no longer uninstall as all config-info has been removed with the device-admin-status.

    So I guess I just have to live with the build I have right now for the rest of my phone's lifetime.

  content: "Poul - I was finally able to removed this app from my Galaxy S2. Its a
    process but it worked.\nI went to systems settings/securitydevice administrators
    (the box was actually checked like the app was activated) I checked the box and
    then selected activate, then I did the process again.\n\nI thin went into the
    app store and typed in IB Notes Traveler. Select Deactivate.\n\nThen go back to
    your home screen, and where ever you have the app icon stored hold your finger
    on the app, and the uninstall word will appear at the top of your screen, drag
    the icon into the install word.\n\nIf this does not work keep following the sequence
    until it works.\n\nOne thing I also did was after each process I rebooted my phone.
    So after you deactivate the device admin, reboot. After you go to the app store
    and select deactivate the app, reboot.  etc.\n\nHope this helps.  It worked for
    me. "

    I found another way.

    Locate and open the app "Notes Traveler"
    Select "Menu"
    Click "Tools"
    There's an option "Uninstall Application"



    You'll have to click through a few "Yes"s

<p>If you ever need to uninstall Lotus Notes Traveler from your Android device you need to first of all remove Traveler from your device administrators list.  If you don't do this the uninstall will fail.</p>
<p>To do this go to...</p>
<blockquote><p>Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Location &amp; Security &gt; Select device Administrators.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then you should be able to complete the uninstall normally.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>A commenter (thanks!) has mentioned that on newer versions of Android the path should be</p>
<blockquote><p>Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Security &gt; Device Administrators</p></blockquote>

    Thanks for this post - it's really interesting to see how people self-negotiate non-fixed working hours.

    I'm interested in your comment: "6 * 5 is only 30 hours a week though, like I say this doesnâ€™t feel like enough to accomplish the various tasks I would need to accomplish"

    You say that doesn't 'feel like enough' (and I feel the same about my working week!), but have you had the chance to test it? If you know you had *only* 30 hours to get your work done, would that help with the procrastination?

    It's a really interesting topic, and I always wonder how much of how long we decide to work is determined by the actual needs of the job, and how much is cultural. The NEF recently released a book in which they claim a 30-hour workweek is both achievable and preferable. I've not had a chance to read it but it seems to tie in with the questions you are asking: http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/time-on-our-side

  content: "This is a good one Toby, and one that I imagine I'll have to figure out
    more in the coming months as I finish my last year of school. These past few months
    I've found that the most critical thing I do is break up my day into chunks -
    which feels like what you've discovered on your own here. \n\n\n\nI recently got
    a dog, and what that means is that every hour to two hours, I'm having to take
    him on a brisk 10-15 minute walk. At times this can be a major pain, as it can
    interrupt my entire line of thinking if I was deep in a problem. However, most
    of the time I feel like these breaks are what keep me on my highest level of performance
    - they're a chance to reset, reflect, stop looking at a screen and problem solve.
    Plus the puppy loves it. It feels like you've already recognized the relative
    pros/cons of breaks like this, but just thought I'd share my own little anecdote.
    \n\n\nAll of that is just to say that it feels like you're on a really good path
    of being introspective about what works, what doesn't work and what might work
    - all relative to your own personality and work style. \n\n\nLooking forward to
    a followup on this soon to see what else you've discovered!"

    Hey Tom - Thanks so much for your comment.

    Excellent point about have I tested it the 30 hours, I haven't. It was just a feeling I had that it feels a little short.

    I don't believe a 30 hour time constraint would help with any procrastination issues, it is too big a block of time, I feel that breaking it into smaller chunks will work better - for me anyway.

    That is really interesting about the 30-hour workweek book, I have a load of stuff I need to read but I will certainly consider reading this at some point! Thanks for sharing.

    and It keeps nudging me back into that workspace during the alloted time. No cheating!
    It's almost pathetic how many strategies I've developed, how many times i've needed
    to change my sudo and email it back to myself so I don't re-edit the hosts file
    so I can go and read reddit. But then I remember that hey, atleast I'm making
    scripts to fix myself. Atleast I'm trying to be better, and in turn I actually
    accomplish stuff! I think there's a market for a distro for procrastinators that
    makes it impossible to get around your shceduled productivity times.

  content: "This may be an issue you've already solved but I thought Id offer it up
    as some free advice. Ever heard the phrase \"Don't shit where you eat?\" Applied
    to working remotely, it means don't do work and do leisurely activities in the
    same place. \n\nWhen I first started trying to work remotely I would find myself
    constantly letting myself procrastinate and get distracted. It's a bit of Pavlovian
    conditioning--when I'm at my home computer I'm in entertainment mode. In order
    to break free of this habit, I started going to my living room with my laptop
    to get work done. Removing myself from the entertainment environment allowed me
    to focus on my work activity once again.\n\n\n\nSo, think about where you want
    to spend you time--both when you are working and when you are relaxing and assign
    those areas to that specific activity.The main benefit to developing this situation
    habit is that when you start working, you will be able to work without distractions.
    Which, will allow you to get a lot of stuff done--a lot more than you would in
    the same time in a regular work environment. When you are more efficient with
    your work time, you won't feel bad or guilty about only working 10-4's during
    the week and utilizing your complete weekend to time off."

    Hey Jeremy, thanks so much for taking the time to comment!

    I was very conscious that this might be an issue for me so one of the steps I have taken is to do all my work in a room I am converting into an office and on a machine that I have never really used for personal stuff before.


    I am have also research co-working spaces.

    I wouldn't say I have solved it, but I think I am in a good way should I ever need to, thanks so much for the advice!

  content: "Hi Toby. I work 100% remotely, most of the time I am working with teams
    3 hours ahead of me. (I'm on the West Coast). My biggest problem seems to be finding
    the best time to be productive as well. A lot of the time, my daytime hours are
    spent communicating, or dealing with regular life issues. \nFinding enough time
    to get things done isn't a big problem. Getting a good sleep pattern and making
    sure to communicate with my family are my own biggest hurdles.\n\n\nGetting into
    a set routine is challenging, but setting aside blocks of time to get specific
    things done is a good solution. Of course, every week or month is a little different.
    December has been a good time to double down on longer term projects and do some
    much needed site maintenance.\n\n\nSeparating a work area from regular living
    and your sleep area is important. Having a designated office area works wonders
    for me. I'm lucky to have glass doors, so I can still see what the family is doing,
    but I can shut out sound to concentrate on work. Using the Pomodoro technique
    or getting up every so often to walk around help immensely. Making sure to get
    a certain amount done each day becomes easier as you condition yourself, and the
    benefits are amazing. I don't miss traffic a bit."

    John J. Locke mentioned, pomodoro technique really helps if you are a procrastinator
    (like I am).\n\nAnd finally and most important, build an \"office\" space inside
    of your house that must be used when you're working.\ngood luck!"

  content: "Being a coder/business owner for 15 yrs this is what works for me:\n-
    No fixed schedule.\n- I set my short term goals (STGs) on Monday and use weekend
    time ONLY if I am not able to complete them M-F.\n- I share my STGs with clients
    so I am accountable and so they know what to review by week end's.\n- For all
    my projects I make nice-to-have and need-to-have lists (or beta/v1/v2 lists).
    Hardly ever nice-to-haves are implemented, no matter what the client says (this
    is our job as developers/consultants: tell clients what they *really* need to
    solve their problems). These lists allow me to focus and complete projects, help
    avoid the feeling of: I will never finish this %#@#%% project no matter how many
    hours I put.\n- No longer than 6 hours/day. I am almost 40 now and programming
    hurts. If I do a 10-12hour run I am zombie the next day.\n- Better one 6hr run
    than 2 o 3 shorter runs with lunch/nap/gym/etc in between. Most STGs take that
    long and if I do not complete them the day I start them, reloading them the next
    day hurts my cabeza.\n- Be a fiddler on the roof: balance all aspects of life,
    work is just one of the many.\n- When coding: just code. For every distraction
    the brain loses precious cycles to get back on track. I close all other tabs/apps/chats.
    I even silence my mobile. Once I get into the zone I am able to get out a few
    hours later with a STG completed/tested/pushed. Can't get into the zone? Develop
    techniques. \n- Programming is unkown territory and a silly bug/new thing I am
    learning can actually take all planned hours until I see the light at end of tunnel.
    No workaround for this one. This will happen even if one is a ninja hacker or
    an aficionado like myself. Solution? I am honest to my clients, I explain what
    happened and let them know early that there will be a late delivery (Software
    projects are always late, who cares for an extra couple of weeks?).\n- Realize
    that I am a wizard and make magic happen for my users/clients. Motivate. Rest.
    Reboot. Another week starts."

  content: As others have shared - the main goal is that you get your work done, not
    that you fill some hours sheet up.  Because you're not in an office anymore your
    job is no longer about keeping a seat warm, but rather, about completing the tasks
    you've been given.  The most important thing then is to know what it is that you
    need to be doing and when its due.  From that you can schedule your time as you
    need to.  Keep in mind that you at some point will probably need to deal with
    other developers so you'll probably want some "standard" hours so you can arrange
    meetings and be available for chatting (mine as an example are from 1230-2 every
    day).  Try to keep your weekend hours to a bare minimum if you have any at all
    because the rest of the world (and all your friends) are going to expect your
    weekends to be available!

    Hi Toby,

        Thanks for sharing this! I definitely agree with your observation on 6 hours/day being the optimal amount of time for "real work"/mentally taxing activities. What system(s) does Buffer have in place to track work, e.g. Pivotal Tracker, Asana, Trello,  etc? Being able to mark off tasks has been a positive boost to my productivity and keeping me focused on the tasks at hand. Even if they don't require it, I would suggest tracking all of your time through Harvest or something similar, so you can monitor the breakdown of time spent on activities throughout the week to find the rhythm that works best for you.

    I've been working remotely for close to three years now and although I realize its not for everyone, my productivity is significantly higher remotely. Breaking the work in chunks with longer breaks in between I've found to work really well, its sort of a mini refresher multiple times throughout the day.

    My only suggestion would be to leave one day completely free from work. Even working just 1-2 hours v. having the entire day to clear your head makes a huge difference. Just knowing you don't have to worry about work for an entire day can really help.

    Hi Toby, one suggestion I have is to find a way to "work out loud" with your team, especially if procrastination is an issue. Here's a great article that highlights the details: http://johnstepper.com/2012/05/26/working-out-loud-your-personal-content-strategy/

    I find that letting my colleagues know what I am working on - as well as seeing what others are doing keeps me focused, on track, and motivated. There are various ways to do this - but what works for me is to keep my Skype/IM status updated with what I'm currently working on.

    Hi Chris,


    Thanks so much for taking time out of your day to comment!

    We use Trello to keep tabs on tasks, and what I normally do is break down the tasks even more inside a personal version of Wunderlist, I will also use this to keep tabs of the non-code related stuff I need to do, like email x about y and things like that.


    I agree that seeing tasks being marked off is an excellent way to move forward and boost productivity :-)

    people expect of us rather than what they actually do expect of us. Does your
    team expect you to sit 8 hrs bum-in-chair, or do they expect you to solve issues
    and move Buffer forward? I think the latter... If it takes you 6 hours a day to
    do it, awesome! (I also find 6 hours/day to be most productive and spend the rest
    of 2-3 hours answering emails and doing the 'daily grind') But sometimes it might
    take you 10, and that's just life. \n\nThat being said, I think when you're a
    remote worker your lifestyle really becomes about the company you serve. It's
    not 9-5 and then close the book for the rest of the day. Yes, you do take a break
    from work to go walk your dog (speaking from experience here), but you're more
    receptive to seeing something on your way that will just give you the most brilliant
    idea! And in this case, living out Buffer might not be such a bad thing :) \n\nIn
    any case, do your best, find joy in what you do and stay open - everything else
    will come. And keep us updated on your journey!\n\nI also found this article that

    I'm happy and getting the job done, all is good :)"

    Hey Ashley, thanks so much for commenting (and for helping with my tax question on Twitter!)


    I like the idea of exercising in the morning to get you into the correct frame of mind :-)

    Thanks so much for your thoughts Alina, I think you are right about the guilt, I know Buffer don't expect it but I guess it is early days for me transitioning from that frame of mind :-)


    Thanks for the link, I will check it out at some point!

  content: I wonder if you were tempted to work over Christmas?! I worked remotely
    for years and loved it. My bosses were never really comfortable with it though,
    and insisted I commute 30 miles to an office to sit there on my own all day. Never
    made sense to me. What did make sense was that I was around at the same time my
    colleagues were, but we were based all over the UK. I don't know how communication
    works out with your team as you are all over the world in different time zones.

    Great question - I did a tiny bit of support over Christmas, but not enough to really count it as work!

    Communication is certainly something we have to be very deliberate about but it is a fun challenge!

<p>Warning: This post is my way of thinking out loud, it will not contain any actionable output for anyone, but I would welcome feedback if you have previously found yourself in the same situation I am currently in.</p>
<p>So I have recently started working at Buffer and the work is 100% remote, the work also doesn't revolve around any particular time based schedule, it is more there is a body of work that needs to be completed and obviously some of that work will be time critical but it doesn't require you to be at your computer say between 9-5 Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>This is very liberating, it means if I feel like I would be more productive working more in the evenings or maybe early mornings I could easily do this, it also opens up a lot of questions, I want to openly discuss two of them.</p>
<p>The main one I can think of is how long should I work for? Both in terms of how much time should be put in over a week period but also on each day what should I do?</p>
<p>Previous jobs have trained me that core hours are between 10 and 4, so my gut feeling is at a bare minimum I should be doing that Monday to Friday, but that doesn't feel like enough time to get good work done, so maybe I should start working the weekends as well? But would that burn me out?</p>
<p>I know from previous experience that after 6 hours of straight coding/concentration I am not going to be too more productive the rest of the day, so increasing that time seems like I would just be wasting energy without too much gain for the company or myself.</p>
<p>6 * 5 is only 30 hours a week though, like I say this doesn't feel like enough to accomplish the various tasks I would need to accomplish, especially when you consider that some of that time each day will be spent catching up with the team and basically doing all the important non-coding work that us coders need to do in order to enable us to code!</p>
<p>I think an extra 6 hours would work well and would make me feel like I was contributing enough bum in chair time with the tasks I am being paid to tackle, so I think I am going to experiment with doing 3 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday.</p>
<p>The next challenge with being able to work my own hours is that I am a world class procrastinator, I could start doing research for a very particular problem and end up jumping around various places each time getting slightly further away from the task at hand and getting too high level with the problem.</p>
<p>I feel that I have two choices, change my nature to make me not procrastinate anymore or realise it is who I am and plan my work around it.</p>
<p>I think changing my nature isn't really going to work, especially not short term. And I don't think that what I am doing is bad, it isn't like I verge into looking at cat pictures, I look at very work related stuff and improve myself as a developer as a result.</p>
<p>So how can I plan my day to embrace the fact that I am likely to stray off point if there are no time pressures. I figure one way to do this is going to be to give myself artificial time pressures, if I know I only have two hours to complete a task, you can be sure I will not veer much further than a useful blog post or a StackOverflow question/answer.</p>
<p>So I am thinking maybe something along the lines of;</p>
<p>Monday - 8am - 10am, 12pm - 2pm, 4pm - 6pm<br />
Tuesday - 8am - 10am, 12pm - 2pm, 4pm - 6pm<br />
Wednesday - 8am - 10am, 12pm - 2pm, 4pm - 6pm<br />
Thursday - 8am - 10am, 12pm - 2pm, 4pm - 6pm<br />
Friday - 8am - 10am, 12pm - 2pm, 4pm - 6pm<br />
Saturday - 11am - 1pm, 2pm - 3pm<br />
Sunday - 11am - 1pm, 2pm - 3pm</p>
<p>That means that I have a lot of 'down time' between these short bursts of work, I plan to use this time to do various things;</p>
<ul>
<li>Errands that I would normally do in the evening, freeing up my evenings a huge amount.</li>
<li>Dedicate time to going to the gym without feeling guilty I am skipping work.</li>
<li>Read the higher level stuff I would have been reading if I thought I had all day to finish a task.</li>
<li>Chill out with my fiancee when she is off work.</li>
<li>Have focused time to read, I am guilty of doing this in the evenings when I am too tired to really appreciate or take in what I am reading.</li>
<li>All the while in the back of my mind I can be churning over the next problem I will be solving in my next two hour window.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way - in case you are thinking, woah, what if someone at Buffer reads about the small amount of time Toby is mentioning for stuff, what would they think?</p>
<p>I am hoping folks at Buffer do read it as I will be sharing it with them! There are some core values that Buffer has and one of them is to work smarter, not harder - I guess what I am trying to do this with post is work out the best way for me to work smarter!</p>
<p>As I said in the intro, would love to hear from you if you have done something similar!</p>

    Hi,
    Curriculum Vitae is "course of life" (Hi, Wkipedia).
    I've just opened this page and "Good things happen to that blog" (http://tosbourn.com/2013/10/development/good-things-happen-blog ) and just thought "What is a blog ? Isn't that a kind of CV ?"

    There are pros and cons, but I think a CV can be eccentric, and self-centered. Yes, you are what is written on your CV, but not only : you live linked to others, and a blog is a good proof of that [social link].


    So, what about a dynamic CV called blog instead of a raw HTML flat page ? :)

    Hey PunKeel - Thanks so much for the comment.


    You are very correct in what you say and I think a blog (or something like a blog, a github repository perhaps?) acts as an excellent social footprint that would help guide anyone that cared to look at what you have done and are aspiring to do.

    I guess the only reason I wouldn't then say "CV be damned, you can see all about me in x, y and z places" is that a CV acts as a nice catch all for anyone who wants to read the abridged version or get a high level view of what you are about. Kind of a personal "about me" page!

    Some way to merge the two would be excellent, I know LinkedIn tries to do that somewhat and the Careers StackExchange does too, but it is a little too automated perhaps, I would still like to hand pick what I professionally present to people.

    And what about putting a list of articles titles on your CV ?
    (Or such kind of self-made idea? To dig, there must be good things to do)

<p>Over the last couple of days I have had several phone calls, emails, tweets, blips, blurps, blaps from recruitment agents wanting to catch up or have a chat with me.</p>
<p>Obviously this is because I am amazing at everything and everyone should want to hire me 100% of the time, but another school of thought it that I posted a social media update saying I had updated my CV.</p>
<p>The reason I posted this rather dull update is to gloat if truth be told, <a title="Typeahead.js The Book!" href="http://tosbourn.com/2013/08/javascript/typeahead-js-the-book/">I was adding the fact I am a published author</a> to it, I am still not over the buzz of it and wanted to do a wee bit of gloating. I thought it was perfectly harmless.</p>
<p>I do make an effort to update my CV regularly though, it wasn't just because there was a major event being added to it.</p>
<p>The fact it was seen by many that perhaps I was looking to move on suggest to me that the majority of folk do not regularly update their CV.</p>
<p>To me this is madness and no matter how happy I am in my work I would never not keep my CV fresh. This is why;</p>
<ul>
<li>I forget stuff, and if I ever am in the position to need my CV for a job the last thing I want to be doing is spending time remembering stuff, I want to be spending time whoring myself about.</li>
<li>It helps me set goals, when everything is written down it is easy to see what is missing and what I might want to focus on over the next few months.</li>
<li>It lets me see where I have come from, it is pretty cool to remember past experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>For anyone interested, here is my <a href="http://cv.tosbourn.com">CV</a>.</p>
<p>Also, for anyone else interested, I am happy at ExamTime :-)</p>

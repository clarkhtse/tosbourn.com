    Hey,

    pretty helpful. I like that it is short (hate too long articles, they get me bored). I checked the Spreadsheet and I will pass it to my sister she has a 'hand made stuff' website. I personally profit from <a href="http://top10binarydemo.com/" rel="nofollow">binary options</a> and I am thinking to make a website about this, so You will be helpful for me.

    thanks and keep writing \//

<p>I am in the process of writing a book on the subject of making your website pay for itself.</p>

  content: "Hi Toby. As soon as I entered my details, I got a notification saying
    that that I will get exactly one email from you once the book is released. However,
    I'm interested in more, reading more from you, and learning more. Things such
    as the book's progress, chapters you're working on, and previews are all of interest.
    \n\n\nPlease send me more than I've signed up for :)"

    Hey there. What a lovely thing to say! thanks!

    Honestly the best place to get all that would be my Twitter feed - http://twitter.com/tosbourn, but I am also going to send you a quick email now :-)

    What is cruft?

    Seriously though - I'd love to know the magic sauce. I used to make money from photos / adsense but Google has long since put paid to that, mostly by stealing all my images and using them like they actually owned them on Google image search.

    Ha - I literally just changed it to cruft (it was 'bullshit') it means like extra unneeded bits. Might reword that again!

    There is a small section of the book dedicated to why I don't (can't) use Adsense.

    Great question!

    The book doesn't talk about individual sites, but does include specific examples from sites I own.

    I have updated the post with the main topics;


    How to work out how much your website is costing you.
    Working out the types of people you can make money off.
    Things I have done to make sure my websites pay for themselves.
    Tracking what money you have been making.
    Some good general advice for your website.
    Some awesome resources that I have used over the years.

<p>Whilst I am yet to make a website I can retire off, almost every website I have made has at the very least broke even.</p>
<p>I have been making websites for a very long time and have become quite good at making sure they pay for themselves.</p>
<p>I have written down my methods, experiments and other things relating to making money on your website and formed them into a book that I have self published. It is a short book,  high on actionable items that I have done in the past and continue to do.</p>
<p>If you know someone that might enjoy a book like this, please let them know!</p>

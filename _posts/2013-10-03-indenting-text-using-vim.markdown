<p>There are several ways to do indenting using Vim, my current favourite is to do the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>Place your cursor where you want to begin to indent.</li>
<li>Press V to select that line</li>
<li>Move down the lines you want to indent using j</li>
<li>Press &gt; to indent, or &lt; to outdent the selected text</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course if you just want to indent or outdent one line you can type &gt; or &lt; when you are on that line.</p>

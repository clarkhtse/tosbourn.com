<p>The new release of <a href="http://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">Netbeans</a> is out of release candidate stage!</p>
<p>Yippee!</p>
<p>I found a handful of things wrong with the RC2 but hopefully they have them ironed out for this release.</p>
<p>This from their website;</p>
<blockquote><p>NetBeans IDE 7.0 introduces language support for coding to the proposed Java SE 7 specification with the JDK 7 developer preview. Developers can now take advantage of the new language features from Project Coin /JSR 334, with editor support for code completion, hints, and in specific cases converting existing Java SE 6 based code to use the new Java SE 7 based syntax.</p>
<p>The release also provides enhanced integration with the Oracle WebLogic server as well as support for Oracle Database and GlassFish 3.1. The Oracle WebLogic server integration enhancements include fast turnaround when redeploying applications; deploy on save; datasource management; server library configuration; the ability to explore deployed applications and resources, and to view server logs and the admin console from within the IDE.</p>
<p>Additional highlights include Maven 3 and HTML5 editing support; a new GridBagLayout designer for improved Swing GUI development; enhancements to the Java editor, and more.</p></blockquote>

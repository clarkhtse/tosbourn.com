<p>Redis has been about for some time now but my first real experience with it was fairly recently whilst at <a href="http://examtime.com">ExamTime</a> and it wasn't something I needed to hack on top of, at <a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a> we have decided to start using it for some new functionality we are building out so I decided it would probably be best to bone up a little on it and get up to speed with Redis.</p>

<p>Before I list the resources I will give a very basic background, so that if you have stumbled upon this page you don't waste your time going through a load of other pages that will be meaningless to you!</p>
<p>Essentially Redis is a key-value store, but it is a bit more than that, this is from the Redis website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced <strong>key-value store</strong>. It is often referred to as a <strong>data structure server</strong> since keys can contain <a href="http://redis.io/topics/data-types#strings">strings</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/topics/data-types#hashes">hashes</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/topics/data-types#lists">lists</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/topics/data-types#sets">sets</a> and <a href="http://redis.io/topics/data-types#sorted-sets">sorted sets</a>.<br />
<cite>â€” <a href="http://redis.io">redis.io</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Here are the resources I have used to help get up and running with Redis;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://openmymind.net/redis.pdf">The Little Redis Book By Karl Seguin</a> - A great freely available PDF book that goes through plenty of Redis related content (disclaimer: I haven't read it all yet, just skimmed some sections).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/phpguru/redis-101-10043219">Redis 101 Slidedeck</a> - A deck of slides going through a basic introduction to Redis</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/noahd1/redis-in-practice">Redis In Practice Slidedeck</a> - A deck of slides going through some real life use cases for Redis</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoQcNgfPYPc">Why and When you should use Redis</a> - A youtube video of a talk given by the author of Redis in Action on why and when you should use Redis.</li>

<li><a href="http://antirez.com/latest/0">Antirez Weblog</a> - The creator of Redis, I figured it makes sense to keep up to date with what is happening on his blog!</li>

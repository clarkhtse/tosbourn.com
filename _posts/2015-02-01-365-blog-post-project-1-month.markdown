<p>At the start of the year I wrote about my <a title="365 Articles in 2015" href="http://tosbourn.com/365-articles-2015/">365 blog project</a>.  If you missed it essentially by the end of the year I want to have written 365 articles around the web.</p>
<p>I wanted to dedicate one of these articles to writing down my thoughts on the project so far.</p>
<p>Before I do I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/keizgoesboom">Melissa Keizer</a> for suggesting I do something like this to reflect on the writing – it was a great idea!</p>
<h2>Some stats</h2>
<p>Including this post I have written 27 articles so far, which is about 7.3% of my target.</p>
<p>I am not aiming to write one a day but if I was I am slightly behind, having said that for the majority of the month I was ahead.</p>
<p>I have written for 7 different websites.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<p>My enthusiasm for this project hasn't changed, which I am very glad of and I am counting as a plus point.</p>
<p>I got to write for one site I wanted to get my name associated with when I wrote <a href="https://www.polemicdigital.com/2015/01/every-web-developer-know-seo/">what every web developer should know about SEO</a> for the Polemic Digital blog.</p>
<p>Speaking of that blog post, I was incredibly happy that it sat on the first page of Hacker News for a while which lead to the head of Polemic <a href="https://twitter.com/badams/status/554681128742043648">tweeting this</a>.</p>
<h2>What didn't go so well</h2>
<p>I didn't write for as many different places as I would have liked.</p>
<p>I have about 5 articles that I really wanted to write in this first month that I haven't got quite finished yet.</p>
<h2>What I want to improve upon</h2>
<p>I really want to focus on getting the writing done for other people who I have promised for for first. Even if they aren't expecting the work by a certain date, it is unprofessional to promise a body of work and then go on to write several personal things in between times.</p>
<p>I want to capture ideas in a better way, right now I am putting them straight into omnifocus, I feel like they maybe need to go into an Evernote document first for me to properly consider and beef out the idea before I put it into omnifocus.</p>
<h2>Thoughts?</h2>
<p>Hopefully you have got at least some benefit from my increased output – I would love to hear your thoughts or feelings on this project.</p>
<p>My current plan is to write another update article in two months time, so I will be 3 months into my project.</p>

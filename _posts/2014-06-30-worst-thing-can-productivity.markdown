<p>About five minutes ago I committed a productivity blunder, I opened my web browser.</p>
<p>As soon as I fire up my web browser my muscle memory takes over. I begin typing in web addresses that have absolutely nothing to do with the task I actually went on the computer to perform and actually hold no interest to me other than they are the websites I *always* visit.</p>
<p>Inevitably one of those websites (Googlemail, <a href="http://twitter.com/tosbourn" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Facebook if you are interested) will give me some new input that I feel I must deal with. This time around it was a tweet that I knew a good friend of mine might appreciate so I <a href="https://twitter.com/tosbourn/status/483706053822271488">shared it with her</a>.</p>
<p>Trying to change my browsing habits isn't going to work in the short term, that is something I need to practice and get better at, so what I need to do is stop the chain of events before it even starts. I need to stop opening my web browser.</p>
<p>I am starting to think that I actually should have my WiFi turned off at all times except for when I actually need it. (side note - I have actually turned mine off now!).</p>
<p>There are plenty of tasks that require you to browse and get the latest information and that is fine but I wonder how many of those tasks are actually core to what you need to get done?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are creating content, do it offline. Go online to save and share the content.</li>
<li>If you are going through content you have bookmarked for research, bookmark it in something with an offline mode like <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>.</li>
<li>If you are replying to emails do it offline so new emails don't come in and you can send your replies in bulk. (Another side note - I am trying out Opera Mail, I will report back with my thoughts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I have already spent enough time not doing the thing I wanted to do tonight! Peace!</p>

<p>I found this sheet last night and have already made use of it.Â  This <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> document lists all of the common Wordpress functions and whilst it isn't as comprehensive as it could be it is certainly a handy thing to have about when a function name is on the tip of your tongue!</p>

<p>I decided subscribing to a service that monitors websites I have a stake in was well overdue, and with a host of free services out there that can do this it seemed silly not to dive in and try one.</p>
<p>The site I decided to trail first is <a href="http://www.uptimerobot.com/">Uptime Robot</a>.</p>
<p>I had two main reasons for trying this one, first it is free which immediately sets it apart from all other sites when all I want is a quick check done and an email sent out if it fails.  The second reason was that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">it's name had Robot in it</span> you can have up to 50 websites being monitored, which is more than enough for me.</p>
<p>As well as email alerts you can set up SMS alerts that will only cost you what your operator charges - sadly there are currently no UK network operators listed, this isn't a huge concern for me because I am always emailed up anyway.</p>
<p>Hopefully in a couple of weeks I can report back and say how awesome this service is and how much money it has made/saved me.  Until then I would love to hear your opinions on different tools you use for uptime monitoring.</p>

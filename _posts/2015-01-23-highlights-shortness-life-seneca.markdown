    "The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs on tomorrow and loses today"



    I've just taped that to the top of my monitor.

<p>I have recently finished reading Seneca's essays collected into the book On the Shortness of Life.</p>
<p>This is the first book related to stoicism I have read, I would like to read more.</p>
<p>I wanted to share some of the highlights I made whilst reading the book, if I am honest mainly for myself when I come to want to refresh my memory on parts but you may find them useful too!</p>
<blockquote><p>So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like the idea of basing length of life on the quality of the life not the years.</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile death will arrive, and you have no choice in making yourself available for that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again this was around the idea of not being idle and having a worthwhile quality of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seneca seems to be the master of one liners like this.</p>
<blockquote><p>So it is inevitable that life will be not just very short but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love the idea of things like possessions ending up being a burden on you.</p>
<blockquote><p>since the luxury of the times has reached the point where an exileâ€™s allowance is more than the inheritance of leading men of old.</p></blockquote>
<p>A reminder of how easy we have it these days.</p>
<blockquote><p>long association brings love of evil as well as good.</p></blockquote>
<p>My takeaway from this is how bad habits can easily form if you do them repeatedly.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let no one rob me of a single day who is not going to make me an adequate return for such a loss.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spending your time wisely.</p>
<blockquote><p>So if you must fill your time, write something in a simple style for your own use and not for publication</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of stuff in the essays around not relying on others, I think this makes a lot of sense.</p>
<blockquote><p>I imagine many people could have achieved wisdom if they had not imagined they had already achieved it</p></blockquote>
<p>Always be learning!</p>
<blockquote><p>Above all it is essential to appraise oneself, because we usually overestimate our capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty self explanatory</p>
<blockquote><p>You must reflect that fettered prisoners only at first feel the weight of the shackles on their legs: in time, when they have decided not to struggle against but to bear them, they learn from necessity to endure with fortitude, and from habit to endure with ease.</p></blockquote>
<p>A reminder that whilst bad habits can easily form over time, so can good ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>all life is a servitude.</p></blockquote>
<p>I liked this as a little sort of mantra, everyone serves someone or the things they own.</p>
<blockquote><p>He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another quote about having a good quality of life and living in the moment more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Know, then, that every condition can change, and whatever happens to anyone can happen to you too.</p></blockquote>
<p>How we shouldn't try and be shaped by fortune because things can and do change, we see it all the time yet we don't expect it to happen to us.</p>
<blockquote><p>So we should make light of all things and endure them with tolerance: it is more civilized to make fun of life than to bewail it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love this line.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, the two things must be mingled and varied, solitude and joining a crowd: the one will make us long for people and the other for ourselves, and each will be a remedy for the other; solitude will cure our distaste for a crowd, and a crowd will cure our boredom with solitude.</p></blockquote>
<p>I spend way too much time in solitude, I should try and vary this some.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our minds must relax: they will rise better and keener after a rest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Couldn't be quoted enough!</p>

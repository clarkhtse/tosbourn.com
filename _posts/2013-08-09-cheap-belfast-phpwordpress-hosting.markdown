<p>Any of my sites that are written in PHP (the majority of them!) I host with <a href="http://www.bigwetfish.co.uk/whmcs/aff.php?aff=264">Big Wet Fish</a>, they are a local company who used to be based out of Belfast but now are based out of Carrickfergus and they offer some of the best web hosting around.</p>
<p>Not only are their prices excellent, more importantly they are brilliant people to work with, they genuinely care about their clients websites, and have developed quite a knack for fixing any problems you might get yourself into when hosting WordPress or PHP websites.</p>
<p>Recently they got in contact with me to say that I could give out an offer code that would make their already cheap prices even cheaper! So I figured I would write a quick blog post that I would link people to.</p>
<p>Disclaimer - I am linking to <a href="http://www.bigwetfish.co.uk/whmcs/aff.php?aff=264">Big Wet Fish</a> using my affiliate code, so if you follow it I will make some money, but feel free to double check, this site is hosted with them and I wouldn't have it somewhere where I wasn't happy, nor would I actively promote them as much as I do.</p>
<p>So I have said PHP and WordPress hosting, I know for a fact people host other things on their servers, but I personally have only used them for PHP projects (although they were kind enough to give me a server to play about with Ruby on some time ago). They are normally more than happy to set up your server to your specific needs, and certainly any time I have ordered something off them they have asked how I want things to work.</p>
<p>You can also buy your domain names through them, and whilst this isn't something they make a big song and dance over, I would far rather have my domains with them as opposed to 123-Reg who I have used before and wasn't happy with at all.</p>
<p>If you want to find out a little bit more about the owner of <a href="http://www.bigwetfish.co.uk/whmcs/aff.php?aff=264">Big Wet Fish</a>, I conducted <a title="Interview with Stephen Kinkaid from Big Wet Fish" href="http://tosbourn.com/2012/04/linux/interview-with-stephen-kinkaid-from-big-wet-fish/">an interview with him</a> a while ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough rambling, you probably just want to know how to get cheap hosting from an excellent local company!</p>
<p>Step 1) <a href="http://www.bigwetfish.co.uk/whmcs/aff.php?aff=264">Go to their website and have a look around</a><br />
Step 2) When you are ready to order use the promo code <strong>bwftoby</strong> for 15% off your order.</p>
<p>To put that into some perspective at the time of writing you could pick up business class hosting (more than enough for most websites) for around £70 or under £20 a year for shared hosting.</p>
<p>£20 a year for hosting? That really isn't something to be sniffed at.</p>
<p>The offer also applies to domain names, which is mental because as far as I am aware they don't actually make any money off selling them!</p>
<p>If you live in Belfast (or Northern Ireland) I think it is a no brainer to go with a company that you could drive 10 minutes up the road to have a face to face meeting with as opposed to some company you are never likely to actually be able get speaking to a real person let alone meet for coffee!</p>

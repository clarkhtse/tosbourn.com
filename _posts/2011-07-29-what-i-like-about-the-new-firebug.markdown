<p><a title="Firebug 1.8" href="http://blog.getfirebug.com/2011/07/29/firebug-1-8-0/" target="_blank">Firebug 1.8</a> has been released and it introduces a handful of really neat features.</p>
<p>Here are the changes/additions I think are going to be most beneficial;</p>
<ul>
<li>The HTML Preview can be adjusted by height.</li>
<li>You should be able to pick the right script far easier now. On some laptop screens I really struggled to select the correct script before, it wasn't great.</li>
<li>CSS colours will show up as their colour.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have only spent a bit of time playing so far, but can't wait to get stuck in some more and for future updates.</p>

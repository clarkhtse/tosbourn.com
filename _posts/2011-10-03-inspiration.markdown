<p>Two things that have inspired me recently, neither are directly linked to development and neither are at all related (apart from being inspirational).</p>
<ol>
<li>The first was a talk by <a title="Gavin Strange" href="http://news.jam-factory.com/post/10860809833/belfast-belfast-belfast-ive-only-been-here-a" target="_blank">Gavin Strange</a>, there are some pictures from the event <a href="http://www.photosby.si/blog/comments/build_break_do_make" target="_blank">here</a> - excellent stuff, a truly inspirational character with some stunning work.</li>
<li>The second are two rather old Michael Jordan Nike videos (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BirIEDYrw0Y" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uugz5Y7u6M" target="_blank">here</a>), they always get me in the mood to get shit done.Â  I don't even particularly like basketball.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to play about on Firefox OS on an actual device you are going to have to wait a while, but if you want to test out some of the applications that are already being built for it and you have an Android phone you are in luck.</p>
<p>Basically you need to install the Firefox nightly (named Aurora) and it has access to the Firefox OS marketplace.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-aurora-android/en-US/fennec-20.0a2.en-US.android-arm.apk">Click this link to install Firefox Aurora</a></li>
<li>Launch the Aurora app.</li>
<li>In the Menu go to Tools &gt;&gt; Apps</li>
<li>â€¦</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>Apps you install go onto your homescreen, which gives you a nice experience when you are testing/playing.</p>

<p>Along your PHP travels you will hear noises relating to installing something from PEAR to help you with some PHP snizz.</p>
<p>PEAR is simply a code repository, in fact PEAR stands for PHP Extension and Application Repository.</p>
<p>Installing it is a breeze assuming you already have php installed (you can verify this by typing <code>php -v</code> into your command line).</p>
<p>The first thing to check is that it isn't already installed â€” a quick command will verify; <code>pear version</code>. If this brings back version information then you are good to go, if it reports <code>Command not found</code> then follow these simple steps.</p>
<p>Download the phar file at this location: <a href="http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar">http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar</a></p>
<p>Run PHP on the file, so if you downloaded it to your Downloads folder then run <code>sudo php go-pear.phar</code>.</p>
<p>You will be asked some installation questions, I quite like the defaults but feel free to change whatever you want.</p>
<p>Next if you have accepted the defaults you will probably want to add PEAR to your path so that you can call it easily from the command line. I like to do this in vi but there are several ways to achieve it;</p>
<p>I run <code>sudo vi ~/.profile</code> and add in my PATH to the bottom of the document; <code>export PATH=/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/pear/bin:$PATH</code>, I then reload my profile with <code>. ~/.profile </code> and that is me, now if I run <code>pear version</code> I get version information.</p>

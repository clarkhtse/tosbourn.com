<p>If Google were to minify their 404 page they would save about 31 bytes per pageload.</p>
<p>I am sure they can make better savings elsewhere, but I would imagine the 404 page is something that gets hit a brave amount and anything would be beneficial.</p>
<p>More savings could be made by giving the images used on the 404 page smaller names too, again this will save only bytes but it would add up over the amount of page views I am sure they get.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

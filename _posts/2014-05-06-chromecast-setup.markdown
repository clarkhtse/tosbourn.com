<p>I wanted to briefly talk about my Chromecast setup, not because I am doing anything novel with it but because there are a few things I didn't know about the Chromecast before I bought one so may be of interest to folks thinking about it!</p>
<h2>Streaming Online Files with Chromecast</h2>
<p>For files that are online so far I have just been using a combination of YouTube inside of the Chrome web browser or the YouTube app on my iPhone and the Netflix iPhone app.</p>
<p>The iPhone apps are pretty useful, one streaming has begun you can close out of the app on your phone and it will continue to work.</p>
<p>Netflix currently doesn't support queuing up multiple things, so if I am watching a series it means at the end of the episode I have to hit play again on my phone. I hope this gets fixed at some stage.</p>
<p>There doesn't appear to be anyway to stream from any other web browser than Chrome, it would be nice if other extensions came out.</p>
<h2>Streaming Offline Files with Chromecast</h2>
<p>For streaming offline files I have been super happy with<a href="http://www.getvideostream.com/"> Video Stream</a>, this is another Chrome plugin that lets you select a file from your file system and it will stream it to your Chromecast. Any media file I have tried has streamed super quick and the quality has been great.</p>
<p>You can also stream local files by dragging them into your Chrome web browser and casting the tab but I have heard mixed reports about this.</p>
<h2>Other things I have learned about Chromecast</h2>
<p>Streaming both online and offline files pretty much covers everything you would want to do with your Chromecast, but I thought I would share two other things I have learned.</p>
<h3>Chromebooks don't have native support for Chromecast</h3>
<p>This was something that kind of confused and annoyed me, I have a Chromebook and I figured it would be the ultimate thing to use to control Chromecast, but it turns out that I only have the same amount of control as I would have using the Chrome plugin. I know ChromeOS is essentially just a loader for Chrome, but I would have thought they would have an app that would let me easily cast my entire desktop.</p>
<h3>Chromecasts can power themselves off of the TV</h3>
<p>So long as you have a spare USB slot in your TV you can power the Chromecast using this, which is nice as it means one less power socket being taken up.</p>

<p>Facebook have just announced their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/products/anonymous-login/">Anonymous Login</a>, on the face of it it seems quite interesting and potentially very useful.</p>
<p>It appears that it will act just like Facebook Login does at the moment but it won't pass any extra information to the application or website for it to store.</p>
<h2>What could be cool about Facebook Anonymous Login</h2>
<ul>
<li>People that use it will have a low barrier to entry to things because they don't have to worry about committing their details to something.</li>
<li>Apps that don't care about personal data but need it for authentication will have one less headache</li>
</ul>
<h2>What worries me about Facebook Anonymous Login</h2>
<p>I do have some concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is Facebook – Facebook loves knowing all these is to know about people and whilst the app that uses this might not know the user details, Facebook will.</li>
<li>There is little information about how it <em>actually</em> works.</li>
<li>The wording in one of their sections confuses me "People using your app can upgrade from Anonymous Login to Facebook Login in just a few taps." the term upgrade makes this seem like a Facebook Login lite. Very odd.</li>
<li>In principal I am against the idea that Facebook is going to market this as them championing the user and anonymity – when that isn't what they stand for.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Beta</h2>
<p>Right now it is still in very early beta.</p>
<p>I have applied for beta access – concerns aside I wouldn't mind having a play! Facebook are a huge company and knowing even the basics of their tech is a wise move in my opinion.</p>

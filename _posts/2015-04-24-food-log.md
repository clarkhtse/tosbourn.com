As an experiment I thought I would try keeping a food log online. This isnâ€™t something I will actively promote (hey everyone on Twitter, come see how fat I am!) but I need to try and do something to get my weight under control.

> What gets measured gets managed.

I am going to try and update this daily with what I had for various meals / snacks and I will put up a weekly weight.

Starting weight (24/04/2015): 246.4 lbs  

Current weight (24/04/2015):  246.4 lbs

Difference: 0 lbs

## The Log

### 24/04/2015

* Breakfast: Scrambled Eggs (3 eggs) and baked beans
* Lunch: Pepperoni Chiabata, Lemon fizzy drink
* Dinner: Small indian curry and rice
* Snacks: Homemade Raki (!!), pint of beer, babybel, fat free yoghurt, 2 chocolate bars, diet coke, diet boost energy drink.

Clearly there are some easy changes I should make in order to improve on this!

### 25/04/2015

This was an off day, I have planned in advance of this log for it to be so I am not too annoyed.

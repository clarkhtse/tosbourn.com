<p>Has anyone played with HTML5 yet?</p>
<p>I recently downloaded a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/06/html-5-cheat-sheet-pdf/">cheat sheet</a> for it and have been dying for a small project to use it on.Â  The problem is most of the commercial projects I work on are such that HTML5 just wouldn't be a viable choice, and all of the personal things I take on I know I don't have that much time for so usually throw things together using a CMS or whatever.</p>
<p>I would be really interested to hear peoples feedback on this, so let me know!</p>

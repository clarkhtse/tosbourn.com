<p><a href="https://twitter.com/iFroggy">Patrick O'Keefe</a> has recently released <a href="http://issuu.com/skimlinks/docs/finalinfographic">a useful infographic to help guide people who are looking to make some money out of their website</a>.</p>
<p>This whole area of being a webmaster is filled to the brim with idiots spouting nonsense to try and make a quick referral buck, Patrick however isn't one of those idiots, he is a proven expert in the field and his opinion is backed by his vast experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>A couple of the takeaways I took from the infographic were;</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the user base first.</li>
<li>The guide to how to handle the roll out of monitising your site.</li>
</ol>

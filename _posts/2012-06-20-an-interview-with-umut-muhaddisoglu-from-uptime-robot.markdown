<p>I was lucky enough to exchange a few emails recently with Umut Muhaddisoglu from <a href="http://www.uptimerobot.com">Uptime Robot</a>, I have used Uptime Robot for <a href="http://tosbourn.com/2010/04/web-stuff/uptime-robot/">some time now</a> and have found it an invaluable tool, so I wanted to find out a little bit more about what makes it tick.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your background.</strong></p>
<p>I'm a web developer who used to run a creative agency and a hosting company. ~4 years ago, the hosting brand is acquired by a larger company and, on the web side, wasn't feeling as excited as before for creating stuff for customers.</p>
<p>As a result, I quit all the setup and started working on my own projects. It started with running WebResourcesDepot (http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/) where I regularly share free web design/development stuff that I may need (so, others may need) one day. It grew so much and, within time, I found the time to focus on another project: which is Uptime Robot.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to start uptimerobot?</strong></p>
<p>I was a customer of multiple hosting companies, had my own hosting company, managed lots of sites-servers and uptime was always a part of my job.</p>
<p>Having used many uptime monitoring solutions, most of them were built with system admins in mind and almost all of them were extra-complicated and high-priced.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I needed something simple (yet stable) that would alert me when a website does not work or an e-mail server stops responding. That's it.</p>
<p>Also, I had a will to build a large-scale web app that handles lots of transactions which would teach me many new things. Uptime Robot successfully did that perfectly with millions of checks/day and lots of logs to deal with :).</p>
<p>And, with the price, "free" sounded like the lowest it can be :) and we are trying hard to keep it so.</p>
<p><strong>Did you do all the work yourself or did you get a team of people involved?</strong></p>
<p>We have built it with Daniel of SSLmatic (http://www.sslmatic.com) and improving it together.</p>
<p><strong>What language does the site use in the backend?</strong></p>
<p>There is too much stuff going on in the background and it is a combination of some EXEs created with C++ and batch files created with VBscript. MySQL is our choice of storing the data.</p>
<p><strong>What problems did you face making it?</strong></p>
<p>None, we knew what we were doing.</p>
<p>But, within time, as the userbase and number of monitors grew, we needed to read + learn so much in optimizing queries and database to make things as fast as possible. There is still lots to learn there.</p>
<p>And, I feel like, within time, we may move some parts of the engine to Node.js (which is what I'm amazed of these days).</p>
<p><strong>If you could start from scratch, would you do anything differently?</strong></p>
<p>We have a built a beautiful monitoring engine, that's what I still think when I view the code. For the front-end, we had focused on simplicity. But now, I can see that it can still be much more simpler (which is what we'll focus on v2).</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any cool features or plans in the pipeline?</strong></p>
<p>There are many things waiting in our to-be-launched and to-do lists. Web-hook notifications, detailed reporting, response time monitoring are few to come. And, we are also working on v2 which shall make monitoring much more simpler.</p>
<p><strong>What is your development setup like? (do you code on a mac, what programs you use, things like that)</strong></p>
<p>I have always been a Windows person. Although Mac and Linux have many advantages over it, "working with what you feel comfortable at" makes sense.</p>
<p>Using Dreamweaver and Notepad++ as the IDE, Navicat as the database manager and Chrome + Firefox (with Firebug) for debugging the frontend.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to add?</strong></p>
<p>Look forward to hearing the tosbourn.com readers' feedback about Uptime Robot.</p>
<p>#End of Interview</p>
<p>Thank you so much to Umut for taking part in this short interview, if you are looking for excellent uptime monitoring you should definitely give them a try.</p>

<p>Recently a couple of non-technical friends and family members have been asking me securing Facebook more than just locking down who can see what.</p>
<p>The best way I know of to achieve a more secure Facebook is to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on Account &gt; Account Settings</li>
<li>Under Account Security hit Change.</li>
<li>Tick to use https://</li>
<li>Tick to email you when a new computer logs in.</li>
<li>Hit Save</li>
</ol>
<p>That is it! 5 steps to a more secure Facebook.</p>
<p>The first thing you tick, use https:// basically means that information that goes from your computer to Facebook will be jumbled up so if any 'hacker' type person will have a hard time reading it. (Without it ticked it is surprising easily to get Facebook logins from a Wireless network!)</p>
<p>The second thing you tick, to email you when a new computer logs in essentially means that each time you log into your account from a new computer (one that Facebook hasn't seen before) it will ask you to give your computer a name.  I just use things like 'TobyMac' or 'TobyLaptop'.  Once you do this you get two pretty awesome things.</p>
<p>The first is an email.  So if someone hacks into your account from their machine you will know about it immediately.</p>
<p>The second thing is you can access a list of who has been on your account (from the different computers), you can get this by going to your Account Security again.</p>
<p>Hopefully this makes sense, is easy to do and will keep you more secure!</p>

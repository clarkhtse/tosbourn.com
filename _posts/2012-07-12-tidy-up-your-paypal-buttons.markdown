<p>If you have been using PayPal for any length of time to accept donations or payments for various projects you have probably gathered up quite the collection of redundant buttons.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time for a quick spring clean? Or perhaps you have stumbled upon this article because you are looking to know where on earth you access the admin area for those buttons, either way — happy reading!</p>
<p>Here is a step by step guide from the main overview page you get once you log into PayPal, the link to go directly to the admin section for buttons is <a title="PayPal Button Management" href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_button-management">https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_button-management</a> but I think it is important to try and find your way around sites manually, in case you don't have access to a bookmark or something.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Merchant Services</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Manage Your Account</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click on the button called <strong>Update Your Selling Preferences Now</strong>.</li>
<li>There should be a list of options, including PayPal buttons, click the <strong>Update</strong> link.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here I would suggest you delete buttons you don't currently use and don't have any use for in the future — it will make your life a little easier the next time you need to update something.</p>

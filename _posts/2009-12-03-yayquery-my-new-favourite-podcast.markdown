<p><img class="alignright" title="YayQuery" src="http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s130/tosbourn/top_logo.png" alt="" width="304" height="150" />This week I found out about a new podcast on the scene called <a href="http://yayquery.com/">YayQuery</a>.  As you can imagine it is a discussion on jQuery, it is hosted by four experts in the field and seems to be producing fairly regular podcasts.</p>
<p>It rules for a couple of reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>It it is such a laid back discussion from people who genuinely love jQuery.  A lot of tech podcasts are very dry, and just hard to listen to.</li>
<li>It mixes n00b and l33t levels of discussion excellently.  As someone who is just above n00b not nowhere near l33t I have found nothing too under or over whelming.</li>
<li>It lets you download it as a vodcast as well as a podcast.</li>
<li>The source code on their site is AWESOME. (seriously, check out <a href="http://yayquery.com/">their site</a> and view the source, awesome)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing they are on episode[3], plenty of time to play catch up!</p>

<p>Recently (this morning) I had to find out which version of Ubuntu was running on a clients machine.Â  A quick google provided three articles of note all with different solutions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Type `cat /etc/issue` into the command line (no back ticks).</li>
<li>Type `lsb_release -a` into the command line (no back ticks).</li>
<li>If you have a GUI, open up FireFox and view the about dialog.</li>
</ol>

<p>I had read some tweets earlier today about the <a href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">Google Font API</a> and thought I would check it out.</p>
<p>Normally the way these things go down is I view the demos and have every intention of trying it myself but there are usually just a couple too many steps involved for the time I have allotted to dicking around the interwebs but this was so quick and so straight forward that I have eliminated cufon from this site in about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Here are the steps I used;</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the link above.</li>
<li>Click on the font you want.</li>
<li>Click get the code.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the link into the head of your page.</li>
<li>Update your CSS with a copy/paste.</li>
<li>Done! (well, I also had to jump onto Wordpress and turn off Cufon in a settings page, but that is specific to my template.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not a designer so I don't really know if those fonts are any good or not from a design point of view, but the potential for breaking away from the standard websafe fonts is huge!</p>

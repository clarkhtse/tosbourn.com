    Cheers for the heads up!

    Someone else had suggested Mind42 which is a free web-based offering.

<p>I wanted to write a quick post about how I plan out my blog posts, which I will admit is a little meta - but with so many people writing their thoughts on things in a blog format I thought it would be interesting to start up a conversation on how different people do it.</p>
<p>I use a brain storming tool called <a href="http://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> to plan out my posts. It lets you quickly get down what you are thinking into small nodes, which you can attach sub nodes to.</p>
<p>The best way to explain this is of a screenshot, and I figured the best way to do this would be to screenshot the MindNode I made for this post!</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/before.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1030" title="MindNode Before" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/before.png" alt="" width="789" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see I can quickly map out what I think an article might end up containing, this is a really quick way to decide if there are enough talking points to continue writing the full article or not, most of the time I have found you can easily get 20-50 words out of an individual node.</p>
<p>You might also have noticed that each child node is to the left of its parent node, this is by design. After I have created the MindNode I use it as a todo list, this makes everything really easy to track as I can just move the completed nodes to the right, like so.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/during.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1032" title="MindNode During" src="http://tosbourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/during.png" alt="" width="923" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>If you have paid attention to the images you will know what I am going to talk about next!</p>
<p>I like using MindNode because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes you focus the points of your blog post - this can help you to avoid waffle or repeating yourself.</li>
<li>It can exhaust the points you wish to explore - if you just start writing the article you could find yourself getting to the conclusion by skipping a few steps.</li>
<li>It is quick to do - It is almost as quick as jotting them down your ideas on a notebook, only your notebook can't be synced with Dropbox!</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I have moved everything over to the right hand side I know I am pretty much done with the article.</p>
<p>If you write content in a blog format I would love to know what you do to prepare it and what tools you use, please leave a comment here or on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3936460">Hacker News</a>, or on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/ta8b7/how_i_use_mindnode_to_help_craft_blog_posts/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>And for completeness, here is my final MindNode!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>I find it way too easy to write in a way that could be considered gender normative.  I would describe someone with gusto as having balls (regardless of their gender) and things like that.</p>
<p>In an attempt to move away from potentially sexist words I decided to have a think about some gender neutral swear words I can use when I want to rant but in a non-sexist way!</p>
<h2>Some examples of sexist swear words</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pussy</li>
<li>Dick</li>
<li>Bitch</li>
</ul>
<p>These are obviously sexist in that they put down a person by ascribing them a gender characteristic. You can argue about the intent all you want but until the meaning of "Bitch" stops meaning a female dog then calling someone a little bitch has to be considered sexist.</p>
<h2>Some swear words that might be sexist?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wanker</li>
<li>Tosser</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these mean the same thing, and whilst both genders masturbate it is almost exclusively assumed to be a male trait. Personally I don't think they are gender normative but others might consider them so, or at least in a grey area.</p>
<p>Coming up is my list of gender neutral swear words, <strong>I encourage you to add more in the comments</strong>.</p>
<h2>Gender Neutral Swear Words</h2>
<p>Now onto the fun bit of this article!</p>
<p>I should say this was way harder than I thought it would be to come up with a list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asshole – (see also: arse, ass, a-hole, etc.)</li>
<li>Fuck – (see also: fucker, fucko, etc.)</li>
<li>Toe-rag – (a personal favourite)</li>
<li>Shite – (see also: shit, shithead, shower of shites, gob shite, etc.)</li>
<li>Eejit – (Northern Irish favourite, it means idiot)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will note I haven't included things that are equally as bad as gender biased put downs, so things that are based on race or sexuality don't have a place in my lexicon of swear words.</p>
<h2>Swearing in Other Languages</h2>
<p>When I was doing research for this a short while ago <a href="https://twitter.com/jbscript">Jonny Buchanan</a> shared with me that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_profanity#Profanity_related_to_illness_and_disability">Dutch folk sometimes swear using words related to illness and disability</a>.</p>
<p>I quite like the idea of the phrase: alles ging naar de pleuris, everything went to the tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In German you can call someone a Schweinepriester – This literally translates as Swine Priest and I think is a good example of a gender neutral animal to compare someone with.</p>

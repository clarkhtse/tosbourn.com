Thank you so much for clicking through to this section. If something I have written has helped you in your development work or in some other way and you would like to give back I would really appreciate it.

Here are 5 things you can do for free that take less than 5 minutes that would really help me out;

* Share the link you enjoyed on social media.
* Email someone you think would enjoy the site and recommend it.
* Add a link to the post or my site from one of your websites.
* [Email me](mailto:toby.osbourn@gmail.com) with ideas for what you would like to see more of on the site.
* Follow me on social media, or suggest to a friend that they should. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tosbourn), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tosbourn)

If you wanted to do something that isn't free. **Make a charitable donation** to whoever you like for as much as you would like.

I am just a person who writes in their spare time, so really anything you choose to do would be absolutely amazing.

Thanks,
Toby

In the UK we are lucky that companies can’t just fire us because they don’t like us – at least they can’t easily or quickly. There are systems in place to stop the things you see in movies were people are told to clear out their desks and leave within the hour.

There are unfortunately no laws to stop them from not having the money to pay you or paying you in a timely manner.

    Hello there,<br/>

    I am Toby - welcome to my site!<br/>

    I mainly talk about web development and tech, that can take the form of reviews I have done on development books and stuff, interviews I have conducted with some awesome industry folk, development help guides I have posted for things I have been stuck on in the past, random other tech topics, and even the odd personal item.
